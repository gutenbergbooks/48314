<h2><a name="ADMISSION_OF_MISSISSIPPI_TO_REPRESENTATION" id="ADMISSION_OF_MISSISSIPPI_TO_REPRESENTATION"></a>ADMISSION OF MISSISSIPPI TO REPRESENTATION
IN CONGRESS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, February 17, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 8, 1870, Mr. Trumbull, from the Committee on the Judiciary,
to whom had been referred a bill from the House for the admission
of Mississippi to representation in Congress, with conditions
the same as in the case of Virginia, reported it back with an amendment
striking out all these, and admitting the State unconditionally.</p>

<p>In a speech, February 17th, in reference to the proposed amendment,
Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Throughout the long struggle
anterior to the Rebellion, and then throughout
the Rebellion itself, Slavery had two voices by which
it was heard in this Chamber and in the country. The
first was that by which its continued existence was vindicated,
or, if you please, the right of Slavery; the other
was that of State Rights. By these two voices was
Slavery heard. Happily, the first is silenced; but the
other is still sounding among us, crying out against
those generous efforts by which Human Rights are assured.</p>

<p>I am not wrong in this statement. From the beginning
it has been the same. How often in times past
have we heard the cry of State Rights! At every proposition
concerning Slavery, at the presentation of every
petition against this tyrannical wrong, at every allusion
to it, the cry was heard. And when the Rebellion broke<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
forth, the same cry was raised against those great measures
of self-defence by which Slavery, our real enemy,
was assailed; and then at each stage of Reconstruction
it was the same. Not a measure of Reconstruction
which has not encountered this pretension of State
Rights. It broke forth in the Virginia debate. It
breaks forth on the present occasion. Again we hear
the voice of Slavery.</p>

<p>This pretension, which is so constantly manifest, finds
partisans naturally on the other side of the Chamber.
It is easy for Senators who have upheld Slavery to uphold
that interpretation of the Constitution which was
the constant ally of Slavery; but it is incomprehensible
how Senators fresh from the great battle with Slavery
should continue in dalliance with the constant ally.</p>

<p>The argument for State Rights proceeds on a misapprehension.
Nobody doubts the right of a State to local
self-government, through which are supplied the opportunities
of political education, and also of local administration
adapted precisely to local wants. This is the
peculiarity of our national system, wherein it differs
especially from the centralized imperialism of France.
But while recognizing the State as the agency for all
matters properly local, it must not be allowed to interfere
with those other matters, being rights and duties,
which are not local, but universal.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, nothing can be clearer than that the Equal
Rights of All must be placed under the safeguard of one
uniform law which shall be the same in all parts of the
nation,&mdash;the same in Charleston and New Orleans as
in Boston and Chicago. It is absurd to suppose that
the rights of the citizen can differ in different States.
They must be the same in all the States; but this can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
be consummated only by the national authority. Therefore,
on grounds of reason, I repel that pretension of
State Rights which would take this just prerogative
from the nation. Understand me, Sir, I do not seek
to <em>centralize</em>, but to <em>nationalize</em>. The partisans of State
Rights, in their efforts to decentralize, would <em>denationalize</em>.
In the name of local self-government they would
overthrow the nation.</p>

<p>If I am asked where I find these national powers, I
answer, that they are in those two great title-deeds of
the Republic, the Declaration of Independence and the
National Constitution. Whether viewed apart or together,
these two are one and the same; but the two
reinforce each other. The Declaration of Independence
finds proper machinery for its great purposes in the National
Constitution, while the National Constitution is
explained, invigorated, and elevated by the Declaration
of Independence. By the National Constitution the nation
is bound to assure a republican government to all
the States, thus giving to Congress the plenary power
to fix the definition of such a government; but by the
Declaration of Independence the fundamental elements
of this very definition are supplied in terms from which
there can be no appeal. By this Declaration it is solemnly
announced, first, that all men are equal in rights,
and, secondly, that just government stands only on the
consent of the governed. Other things may fail, but
these cannot. Whenever Congress is called to maintain
a republican government, it must be according to
these universal, irreversible principles. The power to
maintain necessarily implies all ancillary powers of
prevention and precaution, so that republican government
may be assured. All these powers are essentially<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
national, and not local; they belong to the nation, and
not to the State.</p>

<p>So long as Slavery existed, this definition was impossible.
State Rights were set up against Human Rights;
but with the death of Slavery, followed by the extinction
of the Rebellion, this definition takes its just place
in our national system. Therefore whatever tends to
maintain a republican government and to place it beyond
assault, whatever tends to maintain the great principles
declared at our birth as a nation,&mdash;all this is
constitutional. As well deny that the sun shines,&mdash;as
well with puny arm attempt to drag the sun from
the sky; still it shines. God be praised! the day has
passed when State Rights can be exalted above Human
Rights.</p>

<p>It is for Congress to determine, in its discretion, how
republican government shall be maintained. Whatever
it does in this regard, whether by general law, or by
condition or limitation on States, is plainly constitutional
beyond all question. All is in the discretion of
Congress, which may select the “means” by which this
great guaranty shall be performed. It is a guaranty
by the express text of the Constitution, and it must be
performed. In selecting the means, Congress cannot
hesitate at any requirement calculated to secure the beneficent
result. By condition-precedent, by condition-subsequent,
by prohibitory legislation, by legislation
acting directly on the States or the people, by each
and all of these Congress may act, bearing in mind
always the great definition supplied by our fathers,
which must be maintained at all hazards.</p>

<p>It is vain to say that our fathers did not intend this
great power and foresee its exercise. There it is in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Constitution, clear and commanding; and there is the
great definition in the Declaration of Independence,
clear and commanding. If our fathers did not fully
appreciate their mighty act, neither did the barons at
Runnymede, when they obtained Magna Charta, the
perpetual landmark of English rights. The words of
the poet are again fulfilled: “They builded better than
they knew.” But they did build. They built this vast
temple of Republican Liberty, and enjoined upon Congress
its perpetual safeguard, “anything in the constitution
or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding”;
and, Sir, by the oath which you have taken to
support the Constitution, are you bound to watch and
protect this vast temple.</p>

<p>The recent war has had its losses, terrible and afflicting.
It has had its gains also. First among these gains
is that interpretation of the Constitution which makes
us a nation, and places the equal rights of all under the
protection of the national power,&mdash;being nothing less
than the fulfilment of the early promises of the Fathers.
Too slowly has this been accomplished; but it is accomplished
at last; and it is our duty to see that these
promises are in no respect neglected, and that the Republic,
One and Indivisible, dedicated to Human Rights,
and an example to mankind, is upheld in every part of
our wide-spread country.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on the Admission of Hon. Hiram
R. Revels, a Colored Person, as Senator of Mississippi,
February 25, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The time has passed for argument.
Nothing more need be said. I doubt if
anything more can be said in the way of argument.</p>

<p>For a long time it has been clear that colored persons
must be Senators, and I have often so declared. This
was only according to the irresistible logic of the situation,
to say nothing of inherent right.</p>

<p>If I do not discuss the question, it is partly because
it is now so plain, and partly because on other occasions
I have considered it at length. There is not a point in
the case which I have not argued long ago. Nearly a
generation has intervened since I insisted at home, in
Massachusetts, that all must be equal before the law,
without any distinction of color.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Several years have
intervened since here in this Chamber I insisted on the
same truth, and at the same time showed how, at the
adoption of the National Constitution, colored persons
were citizens according to the terms of all the State
Constitutions, except that of South Carolina, and perhaps
Virginia and Georgia.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> These arguments and authorities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
were not answered then. They cannot be answered.
It is useless to interpose ancient pretensions.
They are dead beyond resurrection. It is useless to interpose
the Dred Scott decision. Born a putrid corpse,
this decision became at once a stench in the nostrils
and a scandal to the Court itself, which made haste to
turn away from its offensive offspring. By the subsequent
admission of a colored lawyer to practise at its
bar this decision was buried out of sight, to be remembered
only as a warning and a shame.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>The vote on this question will be an historic event,
marking the triumph of a great cause. From this time
there can be no backward step. After prolonged and
hard-fought battle, beginning with the Republic, convulsing
Congress, and breaking out in blood, the primal
truths declared by our fathers are practically recognized.
“All men are created equal,” says the great
Declaration; and now a great act attests this verity.
To-day we make the Declaration a reality. For a long
time a word only, it now becomes a deed. For a long
time a promise only, it now becomes a consummated
achievement. The Declaration was only half established
by Independence. The greater duty remained
behind. In assuring the Equal Rights of All we complete
the work.</p>

<p>No man acts for himself alone. What he does,
whether for good or evil, is felt in widening circles,
according to the measure of his influence. This is true
of the Senate, whose influence is coextensive with the
Republic, and reaches even beyond its enlarging confines.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
What the Senate does now will be followed by
other bodies and associations. As the greater contains
the less, so does the Senate contain all these everywhere
throughout the land. In other places there may
be a brief struggle, but the end is certain. Doors will
open, exclusions will give way, intolerance will cease,
and the great truth will be manifest in a thousand examples.
Liberty and Equality were the two express
promises of our fathers. Both are now assured. And
this is the glory of the Republic, before whose mighty
presence, radiant with justice, kings and nobles must
disappear as the ghosts of night at the morning sun,
while the people, with new-found power and majesty,
take their place.</p>

<p>What we do to-day is not alone for ourselves, not
alone for that African race now lifted up. It is for
all everywhere who suffer from tyranny and wrong,&mdash;for
all everywhere who bend beneath the yoke,&mdash;for
all everywhere who feel the blight of unjust power; it
is for all mankind; it is for God Himself, whose sublime
Fatherhood we most truly confess when we recognize
the Brotherhood of Man.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A motion by Mr. Stockton, of New Jersey, to refer the credentials
of Mr. Revels to the Committee on the Judiciary was, after a debate of
three days, defeated by a vote of 8 Yeas to 48 Nays; and on motion of
Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, Mr. Revels was thereupon, by the corresponding
vote of Yeas 48, Nays 8, admitted to a seat.</p>

<p>On a resolution submitted by Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut, providing
that “any treaty for the annexation to the United States of the entire
dominion of any foreign power shall be considered and the question
of its ratification decided in open session of the Senate,” Mr. Sumner
said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">From the beginning I have always held that the
Senate erred in the establishment of secrecy, particularly
with reference to treaties. I think the first
year that I had the honor of a seat in the Senate the
question of a change of our rule in that regard was presented,
and I voted in its favor. I have seen nothing
from that day to this to change my judgment upon that
particular point materially. I think that the rule of
secrecy was a traditional policy which we derived from
the diplomatic usages of the Old World. We came to
it naturally, and it has continued with us down to this
day. Now, personally, I incline to change it; but I
have two suggestions to present, applicable to the pending
question. The first is, whether it is advisable to
change it while it is known that an important treaty
is actually pending; whether the change, if such change
should be adopted by the Senate, should not be applicable
to the future rather than to any pending question.
I merely present that, without undertaking to determine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
it. The other point is, whether a change so important,
not to say so radical, whatever may be the
judgment of individual Senators, like the Senator from
Connecticut, or like myself, should not be referred to
the committee having charge of such questions. I
would therefore suggest that the proposition be referred
to the Committee on Foreign Relations. That
committee will meet next Tuesday, and I have no
doubt will take it at once into consideration.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The resolution was referred accordingly, and, upon the report of the
Committee, was indefinitely postponed.</p>

<h2><a name="ELIGIBILITY_TO_THE_SENATE_QUESTION" id="ELIGIBILITY_TO_THE_SENATE_QUESTION"></a>ELIGIBILITY TO THE SENATE: QUESTION
OF INHABITANCY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, on the Admission of General
Adelbert Ames as a Senator of Mississippi, April 1,
1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I hesitate to say a word in
this debate. The question has been exhausted
on both sides, and to me, I must be pardoned for saying,
it is infinitely plain. It is plain in law; it is plain
in fact. When I say it is plain in law, I believe all the
Senate on both sides will concur,&mdash;for, indeed, the Senator
from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Thurman</span>] stated the law precisely
as I understand it.</p>

<p>We all know that in topography there are what are
called water-sheds, sometimes high, sometimes low, and
from these elevations flow in opposite directions the
currents which there find their fountains. Sir, the water-shed
of this debate is found in the intent; and this
water-shed may be high or low. Suffice it that it is a
water-shed; this is enough. Suffice it that the intent
appears; and this is all that is required, in order to determine
the character of the residence. Show me a citizen
actually in a State, then the intent to remain fixes
his inhabitancy.</p>

<p>The Senator from Illinois [Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] substantially
admitted this rule of law. I agree with him that
there are but two things to be shown: first, what the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
old books call the <i>factum</i>, and, secondly, what the same
old books call the <i>animus</i>. What is the <i>factum</i>? It is
residence. What is the <i>animus</i>? It is intent to stay.
Now in point of law you can add nothing to these.
You may argue till doomsday, you may cite authorities
without number, but you can add nothing to these
two simple requirements, residence and intent.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thurman.</span> Will the Senator allow me to interrupt
him?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Thurman.</span> As he has referred to my statement of
the law, I will say that I did state that those were the two
things necessary, residence and intention,&mdash;that you want
to find out what is residence that creates inhabitancy, and
what is intention that creates inhabitancy; and what I said
was, and I maintain yet, that a residence which is enforced
is no residence, and an intention that the party has no power
to execute so long as he remains in the Army is no intention
at all: an intention that the party has no power to execute
has no virtue whatever.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well,&mdash;I will come to that. The
Senator and myself agree that in point of law there are
two things to be established, and only two,&mdash;residence
and intent. The question that remains is one of evidence;
it is not a question of law. If the Senator were
on the bench, which he once adorned, he would be
obliged to charge the jury in this way. The rule of law
is positive. All that remains comes under the head of
evidence. Now I say by law you must show those two
things, residence and intent, and you cannot add to either
a tittle.</p>

<p>On this occasion, the most important requirement is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
that of intent. This is the requirement that has been
most argued. And here I go back to that original Latin
phrase which dominates this case, and which is in itself
an all-sufficient rule: I mean the <i>animus manendi</i>.
Why is this phrase, so often repeated, handed down for
successive centuries? Simply because, like maxims of
law, or like proverbs, it contains in one short phrase a
rule. You have there a chapter of jurisprudence, if you
please, or a volume. It is the mind, or the intent to
remain, which governs. This is all that the law says.
The law does not go forward and require, as the Senator
from Illinois has argued to-day, that there must be an
act. You find no such requirement in the rule. The
rule is explicit, precise; and here I challenge contradiction.
It is simply the intent to remain, the <i>animus
manendi</i>. Step beyond that and you are lost, if you
undertake to state the law. There is no rule of law
outside of this simple sum-total.</p>

<p>I come, then, to the point that we have before us,
simply a question of intent. I might cite authorities
here. I have some of them before me. I will read one.
For instance, here is Vattel, quoted by Judge Story in
his article on <span class="smcap">Domicile</span> in the “Encyclopædia Americana,”
which Senators familiar with this subject know
is of authority:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Vattel seems to define it to be a fixed residence in any
place with an intention of always staying there.”<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On this Judge Story very properly remarks:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“This is not quite accurate. It would be more correct to
say that that place is the home or domicile of a person in
which his habitation is fixed, without any present intention
of removing therefrom.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here are words completely applicable to the case now
before us. The learned author then proceeds to say:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is often a mere question of intention.”</p>

</div>

<p>And then adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The mere dwelling or residence in a place is not of itself
sufficient to make it the domicile of the party. He must be
there with the intention of remaining, <i>animo manendi</i>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mark the old recurring phrase, with its light and
limitation. Here again I say is the rule. You cannot
go outside of it. If you go outside of it, you are lost.
I am speaking of the rule of law. I know that there
can be no addition to that, because, if you do undertake
to add to it or to take from it, you must depart from
the jurisprudence of every civilized country,&mdash;not only
of our own country, not only of England, but of every
civilized nation on the continent of Europe. In the
jurisprudence of every one of those countries you will
find this same distinct, precise, simple rule.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, allow me to say,&mdash;I say it with entire respect,&mdash;the
confusion in this debate has arisen from
confounding the rule of law with the evidence under
that rule. The rule, I say, is precise, that there must
be intent. But how shall the intent be proved? Sometimes
in one way, sometimes in another; sometimes by
long-continued residence,&mdash;by purchase of property,&mdash;by
the establishment of a home,&mdash;by the establishment
of a place of business,&mdash;by all those circumstances and
incidents which show fixity of purpose. All this comes
under the head of evidence. It does not touch the rule
of law behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p>The Senator from Illinois says there must be an act.
Allow me to say that words are sometimes acts, and especially
if associated with important events. It is a familiar
phrase of law that language enters into what we
call the <i>res gestæ</i>; language is welded into the transaction
and becomes a part of it. Words then become
things; and when were words more things than when
the commanding general in Mississippi distinctly declared
his purpose to resign his commission in the
Army of the United States and accept a nomination
as Senator? Here was a declaration constituting part
of the <i>res gestæ</i>, and in itself an act.</p>

<p>I am not speaking merely on theory. I have in my
hand a case, which I think, when I read it, you will
see is applicable: I refer to Metcalf’s Reports, volume
three, page 200, the case of <i>Kilburn</i> v. <i>Bennett</i>. In the
statement of facts is the following passage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“For the purpose of showing with what intent the defendant
went to Tyngsborough on the 27th of April, he offered to
prove that about three weeks before that day he told S. Shattuck,
in whose house he then resided, that he should leave
Groton before the 1st of May, and remove with his family to
Tyngsborough, to reside at his brother’s, and make his house
a home, until he should go to Illinois. But the judge ruled
that the evidence was inadmissible, and rejected it.”</p>

</div>

<p>The case was carried before the full bench, when the
ruling of the judge below was set aside, and the Court
observed as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Court held that this, being the mere declaration of
the defendant, was not competent evidence in his favor, and
it was rejected. The general rule undoubtedly is, that a party
cannot give in evidence his own declarations in his favor,
unless they accompany some act, and are a part of the <i>res
gestæ</i>. But it appears to us that the declarations offered to
be proved are within the qualification of the rule. They were
made in the ordinary course of business, and in relation to
the defendant’s removal, and they were made to the owner
of the house in which he was at the time residing. This
giving notice of his intended removal is to be considered an
act which he might prove in any case in which it became
material; and if so, all that he said explanatory of his intention
in relation to his removal seems to us to be admissible
in evidence.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now on the authority of this case it seems to me that
the declaration of General Ames, accompanied by the
acceptance of candidacy as a Senator, is clearly an act.
But I do not argue that the Senate is now bound by
any technical rule of this kind. It is enough if the
Senate is satisfied with regard to his intent on the evidence
adduced. No rule of limitation or exclusion can
prevail. If the Senate believes that he had at the time
the <i>animus manendi</i>, it must act accordingly.</p>

<p>Is the Senate, on the evidence before it,&mdash;without
the application of any technical rule of evidence, without
recognizing his declaration as part of the <i>res gestæ</i>,&mdash;is
the Senate satisfied that at the time named he
intended to reside in Mississippi? This is the whole
case. On this question of fact each Senator will judge
for himself, on the evidence before him. This evidence
I will read in the Report of the Committee, being the
language of General Ames in a written statement to
them, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A number of persons in Mississippi visited this city to
find arguments by which I might be influenced to become
a candidate. I hesitated, because it would necessitate the
abandonment of my whole military life. Finally, for personal
and public reasons, I decided to become a candidate
and leave the Army. My intentions were publicly declared
and sincere.”</p>

</div>

<p>On which the Committee remark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The intentions thus declared were not only to become a
candidate for the Senate, but to remain and reside in Mississippi.”<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir, what more can you ask? On the report of your
own Committee you have explicit evidence of the intent
of General Ames to reside in Mississippi; and
where intent is enough, you need add nothing to it.
There is no necessity for any act beyond this declaration,
which, as I have already said, is in itself an act, as
the Senator from Michigan [Mr. <span class="smcap">Howard</span>] says, taken
in connection with his personal presence on the spot,&mdash;and
I would add, taken in connection with all the necessary
implications from his position, and from his acceptance
of the candidacy. This is not a case in a justice’s
court, or even in a county court. This is the
Senate of the United States; and we are considering
the evidence with regard to the declarations of a gentleman
already chosen by a State of this Union to take
his seat among us. We cannot apply to these declarations
any technical rule which possibly might be applied
in an inferior tribunal. We are to look at the
case in its essence, and, if satisfied of the intent, we
cannot go further. The Senate does not sit in chains.
It may act according to its conscience on the evidence,
without any constraint, except from the rule of law requiring
intent.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>
<p>Much stress has been laid upon the fact that General
Ames held a commission in the Army of the United
States, and was actually the military commander and
provisional governor of Mississippi. What then? Does
this affect his position now? Is a soldier or officer in
the Army, is the commander of an army, shut out from
the same privileges that belong to you, Sir, and to me?
Each of us may change his domicile as he pleases, and
to-morrow or next week transfer his home to another
State of the Union, and nobody can say, No. Has the
soldier or the officer fewer rights than you and I have?
I think not; and I am sure that both reason and authority
sustain my conclusion. I have in my hands a
volume of the California Reports,&mdash;the twenty-eighth
volume. I call attention to the case of <i>The People</i> v.
<i>William Holden</i>, and I will not trouble you with anything
more than one clause from the marginal note, as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Residence while in the service of the United States.</i>&mdash;The
clause in the Constitution of this State, which declares that
‘no person shall be deemed to have gained or lost a residence
by reason of his presence or absence while employed
in the service of the United States,’ does not prevent a
person who removes to a county while in the service of
the United States from acquiring a residence in that county
while in the said service, if it is his intention so to do.”</p>

</div>

<p>“If it is his intention so to do.” These words are
strictly applicable to the case of General Ames. There
was nothing in his service in Mississippi, nothing in his
high military command, to prevent him from establishing
an inhabitancy in that State, if it was his intention
so to do.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus at every point are we brought back to the single
rule of law and the evidence under it,&mdash;the rule being
that there must be an intent to remain, and the evidence
being open to the judgment of the tribunal before
which the question is raised. Especially must this be
the case with the Senate, which will look through all
technicalities, all cobwebs, to find the truth. Nor can
the Senate be so unjust to any class of citizens as to say
that a military commander may not acquire inhabitancy
in a State where he is fixed by military duties, provided
he so intends. All the adverse presumptions from military
residency will be overcome at once by the <i>animus
manendi</i>, so soon as this is proved.</p>

<p>Do you remember, Sir, a pointed remark made by
Lafayette in the French Chamber, shortly after Louis
Philippe was crowned King? Astonishment was expressed
that the great defender of Liberty should espouse
the cause of a Bourbon and help him to the
throne. Lafayette, with remarkable condensation of
phrase, replied, that he was in favor of Louis Philippe,
not <em>because</em>, but <em>notwithstanding</em> he was a Bourbon,&mdash;“not
<em>because</em>, but <em>notwithstanding</em>.” And in
this famous saying of the great French-American you
have terms strictly applicable to this case. General
Ames, soldier, officer, military commander in Mississippi,
became an inhabitant thereof, not <em>because</em>, but
<em>notwithstanding</em> he was soldier, officer, and military
commander.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>A resolution of the Committee on the Judiciary, declaring General
Ames “not eligible,” was on motion of Mr. Sumner amended by striking
out the word “not,”&mdash;Yeas 40, Nays 12,&mdash;and thus amended
was agreed to without a division.</p>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech at a Serenade before Mr. Sumner’s House
in Washington, April 1, 1870.</span></p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The occasion was the promulgation by the Secretary of State of the
ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment to the Constitution. A large
number of citizens, after calling upon the President and Vice-President,
by whom they were addressed, proceeded to the house of Mr.
Sumner, who appeared with his friend, Mr. James Wormley, and spoke
as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;I congratulate you upon
the great result that has been accomplished. For
years my hope and object have been to see the great
promise of the Declaration of Independence changed
into performance,&mdash;to see that that Declaration became
a reality. [<i>Cheers.</i>] This at last is nearly consummated.
I do not say entirely consummated, for it
is not.</p>

<p>It is my nature, fellow-citizens, to think more of
what remains to be done than of what has been done,&mdash;to
think more of our duties than of our triumphs;
and only to-day I have heard from Philadelphia of a
decision in a court of justice that a person of foreign
birth could not be naturalized in this country because
of color. This is in pursuance of one of those old statutes
of the days of Slavery, before the word “white”
was stricken from the laws. Repeatedly, from my seat
in the Senate, I have made appeals for the expunging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
of that word from the laws. I have now a bill before
the Judiciary Committee to strike this word from our
naturalization laws. What the Committee will do remains
to be seen. I need not say that I shall try to
impress upon the Senate the importance of passing this
bill. It remains also, that equal rights should be secured
in all the public conveyances and on all the railroads
in the United States, so that no one shall be excluded
by reason of color.</p>

<p>It further remains that you here in Washington
shall complete this equality of rights in your common
schools. You all go together to vote, and any person
may find a seat in the Senate of the United States; but
the child is shut out of the common school on account
of color. This discrimination must be abolished. All
schools must be open to all, without distinction of color.
In laboring for this, you will not only work for yourselves,
but will set an example for all the land, and
most especially for the South. Only in this way can
your school system be extended for the equal good of
all. And now, as you have at heart the education of
your children, that they may grow up in that knowledge
of equal rights so essential to their protection in the
world, it is your bounden duty here in Washington to
see that this is accomplished.</p>

<p>Your school system must be founded on Equal Rights,
so that no one shall be excluded on account of color.
In this way Human Rights will be best established.
And I would remind you, although this has not been
effected, the victories already gained are the assurance
that all that should be done will be done.</p>

<p>You have progressed, step by step, until you have
reached your present position; and now it only remains<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
that you should continue to the end earnest, faithful,
and determined; then will the work be completed.</p>

<p>Returning you my sincere thanks, and offering my
felicitations on this occasion, I bid you good night.</p>

<h2><a name="ADMISSION_OF_GEORGIA_TO_REPRESENTATION" id="ADMISSION_OF_GEORGIA_TO_REPRESENTATION"></a>ADMISSION OF GEORGIA TO REPRESENTATION
IN CONGRESS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, April 5, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Representatives from Georgia had been admitted to seats in Congress
in July, 1868, under the Act of June 25th of that year; but the
subsequent action of her Legislature in expelling its colored members
and filling their places with whites, and the continued outrages upon
loyalists, had the effect of preventing the admission of her Senators,
and in the next Congress of excluding her from representation altogether,&mdash;involving
the necessity of measures for her reconstruction
and admission anew. The first of these was the Act of December 22,
1869, providing, among other things, for the reorganization of the
State Legislature, by reinstating its colored members in their seats
and purging it of its disloyal elements. To this succeeded a bill in
the same terms with the Acts for the admission of Virginia and Mississippi,
which was passed in the House with the following amendment,
moved by Mr. Bingham, of Ohio:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That nothing in this Act contained shall be construed to vacate
any of the offices now filled in the State of Georgia, either by the election
of the people or by the appointment of the Governor thereof by and
with the advice and consent of the Senate of said State; neither shall this
Act be construed to extend the official term of any officer of said State beyond
the term limited by the Constitution thereof, dating from the election
or appointment of such officer, nor to deprive the people of Georgia of
the right under their Constitution to elect Senators and Representatives
of the State of Georgia in the year 1870; but said election shall be held in
the year 1870, either on the day named in the Constitution of said State or
such other day as the present Legislature may designate by law.”</p>

</div>

<p>In the Senate, after several days’ discussion of this proviso, as in
Committee of the Whole, Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, moved a
substitute of opposite character, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That, in consequence of the failure of the General Assembly
of Georgia to perfect a legal organization for a period of over eighteen
months, it be, and hereby is, declared that the term of service of the said
General Assembly shall date from the 26th of January, 1870, and shall continue
until the persons to be chosen on the Tuesday after the first Monday
of November, 1872, as members of the General Assembly of said State, are
qualified: <i>Provided</i>, That the last clause of the second subdivision of the
first section of the third article of the Constitution of Georgia, in the following
words, ‘The General Assembly may by law change the time of
election, and the members shall hold until their successors are elected and
qualified,’ shall never be by any Legislature exercised so as to extend the
term of any office beyond the regular period named in the said Constitution;
and the said General Assembly shall by joint resolution consent to
this fundamental condition before this Act shall take effect.”</p>

</div>

<p>April 5th, Mr. Sumner spoke on the pending question as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Whatever its result, this debate
will be ever memorable. For the first time
the African has pleaded in this Chamber.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> But the curious
observer cannot fail to note that he was obliged
to plead still for his long-oppressed race. The Senator
from Mississippi sits among us, and speaks; but the
battle is not yet won. Slavery still asserts her ancient
predominance, finding strange voices. No longer is the
claim made directly. Nothing is said of Slavery, but
the old cause is defended under an <i>alias</i>. It is now
State Rights which are invoked, or it may be alleged
irregularities,&mdash;as if State Rights or any irregularities
could prevail against the sovereign duty of Congress to
see that Georgia is so organized that good people shall
be protected in their rights. To this end all else must
be tributary, while every pretext of State Rights and
every allegation of irregularity are of less consequence
than the breath with which they are urged.</p>

<p>It is sad that the Senator from Mississippi should be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
doomed to encounter this spirit. As he entered the
Chamber, the evil genius should have departed; but it
is not so. And strange to say, the voices by which it
has spoken have been the voices of friends. But so it
has been always. How often in other days have the
opponents of Slavery been saddened by encountering
the voices of friends! The argument of technicality is
always at hand, as the well-seasoned weapon of the
lawyer,&mdash;and this debate is no exception.</p>

<p>I had hoped that this question would be decided
without debate, at least on our side,&mdash;in short, that
all would appreciate the exigency, and unite harmoniously
in applying the remedy. I am disappointed.
But I shall say very little. Feeling as strongly as I
do, and seeing the way as clearly as I do, I cannot be
entirely silent.</p>

<p>The case is very simple. From unquestionable evidence
it appears that Georgia, while still in transition
from the old to the new, while still in process of Reconstruction,
and before the work is completed, has lapsed
into a condition of insecurity and uncertainty, so that,
without the intervention of Congress, the people cannot
be assured in the enjoyment of their rights.</p>

<p>This is the broad statement, which is confirmed by
the present as well as the past. By an unparalleled
audacity colored citizens were expelled from the Legislature
simply on account of color, while the orgies
of the Ku-Klux-Klan prevailed throughout the State.
And now this same Ku-Klux-Klan continues its terrors,
while former Rebels threaten to regain their pernicious
power. The State is in peril. I do not use too strong
language. All evidence is at fault, if it be not as I say.
To allow these Rebels to prevail is to sacrifice Reconstruction,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and to offer up the Unionists, white and
black. It is to do a deed of shame and desertion.
Are you ready for this degradation? Shall Congress
descend to this vileness?</p>

<p>Again I use strong language; but only in this way
can I picture the enormity which is now proposed.
Among national obligations which cannot be declined
or postponed, and which rest primarily on Congress, is
the duty of protecting Reconstruction. <em>Show that Reconstruction
is in peril, and you must act.</em> Now that it
is in peril there can be no question. Concurring testimony
from opposite quarters, public acts, and open
menace, all attest the condition of Georgia. Others in
this debate have entered into details. I give you the
irresistible, unanswerable conclusion.</p>

<p>And here occurs the Bingham Amendment, which,
however intended, is only an engine of Rebel power.
This is its true character, and nothing else. Howsoever
it may seem, it must be regarded in its consequences.
We must look from the word to the thing.
It is not enough to see how it reads; we must see how
it works. According to its text, the present Legislature,
whose natural existence has been changed by wrongful
addition and wrongful subtraction proceeding directly
from the old Rebellion, is terminated at a specified day
in the coming autumn, and a new election is ordered,
without taking into consideration the past or the future,&mdash;without
considering that thus far it has sat as a provisional
Legislature only, although chosen to sit under
the State Constitution,&mdash;without considering how it has
been despoiled of its legislative character and just rights
by hostile influence, and how a new election will be a
direct appeal to this same hostile influence, giving to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
it a letter of license and unloosing the Ku-Klux-Klan.
The Bingham Amendment is in few words, but they are
words of despair to the loyal men of Georgia, and words
of cheer to the disloyal.</p>

<p>I have listened to the arguments in its favor. Do I
mistake, when I say that they all resolve themselves
into technicality? At one moment we have allegations
of “irregularity,” and at another of “estoppel”; and
such technicalities play their part, while the good people
of Georgia are sacrificed. We are estopped, so it is
said, by the Act of December 22, 1869, which, failing
to provide for the re-performance of certain conditions-precedent,
recognized the validity of the legislative acts
by which they had been performed. Very well,&mdash;suppose
the legislative acts are recognized as valid, what
then? Because the ratification of the Constitutional
Amendments is recognized, does it follow that Congress
is thereby “estopped”&mdash;such is the word&mdash;in
completing the work of Reconstruction? I cannot comprehend
this reasoning. It would be of value in a county
court, but it is out of place in the Senate of the United
States, on a question of Reconstruction. To my mind,
all this is a matter of supreme indifference. The powers
of Congress are above any such incident, and nothing
has occurred to impair them in any way. They
exist now as at the beginning, awaiting the discretion
of Congress.</p>

<p>Do you ask where these powers are found? Of
course, in the two Constitutional Amendments already
proclaimed,&mdash;being ample sources, if none others existed.
Out of these Congress is authorized to do all that
is needed to enforce Emancipation and to protect the
rights of the citizen. This is plain, very plain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>But there are three other sources, each of which is
overflowing. The first is from the necessity of the case,
<i>ex necessitate rei</i>. This is one of the grounds on which
Chief-Justice Marshall asserted the power of Congress
over the Territories;<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> but it is equally applicable in the
work of Reconstruction. From the necessity of the case
this power must be in Congress, as without it Reconstruction
could not be completed. You must renounce
Reconstruction or recognize this power.</p>

<p>Then comes the “guaranty” clause, which is another
bountiful, all-sufficient fountain. The United States
are to guaranty a republican form of government to the
States. But this guaranty can be executed only through
Congress. This clause is at once old and new. It is old
as the Constitution itself, but it is new in its practical
exercise. And the reason is obvious. So long as Slavery
prevailed, this mighty power slept; but it was the
sleep of a giant. At last it has awaked, never again
to sleep or slumber. From this time forward the duty
of the nation to guaranty a republican government to
all its parts will be constant and ever-present; and this
duty is reinforced by all needful powers. The guaranty
is continuing and perpetual, and it must be executed
at all hazards. In its execution Congress must fix the
definition of a republican government. How often have
I said this!&mdash;but I shall not fail to repeat it so long as
the occasion requires. To Congress belongs the duty of
determining what is a republican government, and then
it must see that such a government prevails in every
State.</p>

<p>If in any State the existing government fails according
to the just standard, or if it is in any way menaced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
then must Congress interfere to execute the sleepless
guaranty. And in this interference it may act according
to its discretion, determining the occasion and the
“means” to be employed. It may act by repression or
by precaution, and it may select any “means” proper
for the purpose. To say that it may not act by precaution
as well as by repression is contrary to reason, and
I may say to common sense. Whatever may be done
by repression may be done by precaution also. Such is
the experience of life in other things, and this obligation
of guaranty is subject to the universal law. In the
selection of “means” the whole field and the whole arsenal
are at its command. Not an instrument, not a
weapon, proper for the purpose, which it may not grasp.
Here the language of Chief-Justice Marshall, so often
quoted, harmonizes with the claim of power which I
now make:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Government which has a right to do an act, and has
imposed on it the duty of performing that act, must, according
to the dictates of reason, be allowed to select the means;
and those who contend that it may not select any appropriate
means, that one particular mode of effecting the object is
excepted, take upon themselves the burden of establishing
that exception.”<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In our recent debates able Senators have denied everything.
They will not concede the “means”; and
they even ignore this great clause, which, as Cicero said
of the ancient <i>Senatusconsultum</i>, has rested so long like
a sword in its scabbard.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> But there it is. Senators<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
may ignore it; they may not see it; but there it is in
the Constitution. In attempting to belittle this clause
Senators only show how little they appreciate the lofty
unity of the Republic. Other clauses are important
in the machinery of government; but this guaranty
makes the Republic one and indivisible, being One out
of Many, and places the rights of all under the protecting
power of the nation.</p>

<p>Before the extinction of Slavery, State Rights were
successful against this guaranty. To invoke this tyrannical
pretension was enough. How often was it heard
on this floor! How completely did it dominate the
Constitution itself! But the habit still continues, and
we are still compelled to hear this same pretension, under
which States <em>played the turtle</em>, drawing head, legs,
and tail all within an impenetrable shell. With the
overthrow of the Rebellion on the bloody field this pretension
should have been abandoned and forgotten. A
State is not a turtle, which can shut itself within its
shell, and enjoy its own separate animal existence; but
it is a component part of this great Republic, with
which it is interlaced and interlocked so as to share
with every other State a common life, subject to one
and the same prevailing law. To insist that a State
can play the turtle now, as in the days when Slavery
ruled, is to dishonor the Constitution, and to abandon
the crowning victory over the Rebellion.</p>

<p>Do you ask for the power in the Constitution to enter
into a State and establish republican government?
I give it to you in an immortal text. To question it
is to show an ignorance of language which in this case
is clear beyond criticism, and an ignorance also of the
true genius of American institutions, where unity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
rights is the Alpha and the Omega. The national
motto, <i>E Pluribus Unum</i>, is another expression of that
great unity by which the States are lost in the Nation.
And this guaranty I now invoke for the protection of
the good people of Georgia, and for the protection hereafter
of Human Rights, when imperilled anywhere within
the limits of the Republic.</p>

<p>But there are other and exceptional reasons why
Georgia is still within the control of Congress. The
process of Reconstruction in this State is not yet completed;
so that the government there is simply provisional,
and nothing else. This is only according to the
Reconstruction Act of March 2, 1867, where it is provided,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, until the people of said Rebel States shall be <span class="smcap">by
law</span> admitted to representation in the Congress of the United
States, <em>any civil governments which may exist therein shall be
deemed provisional only</em>, and in all respects subject to the
paramount authority of the United States at any time to
abolish, modify, control, or supersede the same.”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing can be more explicit. Until the people of
the Rebel States are “by law” admitted to representation,
they are under the power of Congress. Everything
done is inchoate, and nothing more. But Georgia is not
yet “by law” admitted to representation, and we are
now considering when and how such admission shall
take place. Meanwhile, according to express language
of the Act, the government is “provisional only.” Nor
is this all; for the Act proceeds to declare further that
this government is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span> “in all respects subject to the paramount
authority of the United States at any time to
abolish, modify, control, or supersede the same.” Words
cannot be stronger. “Abolish,” “modify,” “control,”
“supersede.” To argue against their plain meaning is
simply ridiculous. To insist that the existing government
is beyond the reach of Congress, to be extended or
abridged, to be recognized or superseded in its discretion,
is preposterous. The power is reserved in terms almost
excessive in fulness. Therefore do I say there can be
no question of power on the present occasion. As well
question that the sun shines or the river flows.</p>

<p>There being no question of power, there arises, then,
the obligation of duty. Congress has the power to protect
republican institutions in Georgia, and to protect
the good people there; and it has the further power to
superintend the work of Reconstruction to the end. All
this it must do. It cannot abandon the appointed work.
Of course it will ascertain the exact condition of things,
and will then apply the remedy. No excuse of State
Rights, no fine-spun technicality, no plea of irregularity,
no argument of “estoppel” can be heard. All these
are trivial and unworthy against the commanding duty.
Georgia must be saved to herself and to the Union, and
Congress must supply the means.</p>

<p>Several courses are open to Congress, and all equally
within its powers; for all are derived from the same
fountains.</p>

<p>1. Georgia may be remanded for an indefinite period
to a condition like that of the Territories, subordinate in
all respects to the jurisdiction of Congress, which may
meanwhile mould it into loyalty and order.</p>

<p>2. Or the State may be subjected to a military government,
until such time as it is fit in every respect
for self-government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>

<p>3. Or the existing provisional government may be invested
with the powers of the State, in such form and
way and for such term as Congress in its discretion
shall think best.</p>

<p>I doubt not that there are other modes within the
jurisdiction of Congress; but these are all contained
substantially in the three I have named.</p>

<p>It is not now proposed to remand Georgia to a territorial
condition, or to subject the State to a military
government. But it is proposed to place it in charge
of the existing provisional government, which is to continue
for a full constitutional term; and this is done as
the best way of guarding against disturbing forces from
the late Rebellion. It is said that this will be sufficient.
I hope that it may be. I am satisfied that it is
the least Congress can do in the exigency. Anything
short of this will be the betrayal of those who have a
right to our protection.</p>

<p>Against this simple and moderate proposition is interposed
the Bingham Amendment, which, however plausible
in form, is destructive in consequence. It is enough
that it hands over the State to misrule and violence.
Senators, how can you do this thing? How can you
hesitate to take every heed and precaution against even
the possibility of such an occurrence? You have the
power. Then must you exercise it. In the recent history
of Georgia nothing can be adduced to make you hesitate.
On the contrary, all things, when properly understood,
conspire to constrain the exercise of this power.</p>

<p>How feeble is the argument, that, <em>because</em> Governor
Bullock was chosen Governor and the Legislature commenced
its session at a given date now past, therefore
in this process of Reconstruction the constitutional term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
of the Governor and of the Legislature must be limited
to two years from that date! Besides ignoring all the
controlling powers of Congress, this assumption ignores
also the conduct of this very Legislature by which its
organization was for a while defeated. Nothing is clearer
than that the termination of the provisional government
in Georgia was contingent on the performance of
certain covenants, express and implied. These covenants
have been outrageously violated. The very form
of government underwent a change when persons clearly
ineligible from disloyalty were allowed to take part
in it, while citizens entitled to equal rights, and especially
protected by the Reconstruction Laws, were tyrannically
ejected from the Legislature. There was for
the time being a usurpation. Had this violation of
underlying covenants been anticipated, Reconstruction
would have been postponed. No Senator will pretend
the contrary. But Congress, in view of what has occurred,
may justly do what it would have done, had it
anticipated the result. It may postpone Reconstruction,&mdash;treating
the Legislature meanwhile as provisional,
and recognizing its acts only so far as in the judgment
of Congress they are fit to be recognized.</p>

<p>If instruction be needed on this point, it will be found
in the authoritative words of publicists, showing how
even the terms of a treaty may be disregarded where
there has been a change in the form of government.</p>

<p>Thus, Vattel does not hesitate to say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It may say, upon a good foundation, that it would not
have entered into an alliance with that nation, had it been
under the present form of government.”<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>
<p>One of our own publicists, Alexander Hamilton, has
dealt with the same question in congenial language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Contracts between nations, as between individuals, must
lose their force where the considerations fail.</p>

<p>“A treaty pernicious to the state is of itself void, where
no change in the situation of either of the parties takes place.
By a much stronger reason it must become voidable at the
option of the other party, when the voluntary act of one of
the allies has made so material a change in the <em>condition of
things</em> as is always implied in a radical revolution of government.”<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

</div>

<p>We but follow the simple principles of these texts,
when we declare that the outrage perpetrated in Georgia
so far changed the condition of things that the
Legislature lost all title to recognition by Congress.
It ceased to be the Legislature contemplated by Congress.
Nor was it the first regular Legislature contemplated
by the State Constitution. It was irregular, abnormal,
revolutionary. To recognize such a body as the
first regular Legislature is a fraud on the State Constitution.
To insist that members chosen as the first regular
Legislature shall be treated as provisional only is
unjust to them. To insist that such members shall
be despoiled of the regular term is a direct surrender
to the disorganizers, who will rejoice to see Congress
sacrifice the true men to whom it owes protection.
To my mind there can be no surer rule than so to act
that these disorganizers shall not rejoice. Especially
will I not please them at the expense of patriot citizens.</p>

<p>In the exercise of this power Congress is acting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
principles of Equity. And here allow me to say, that,
in superintending the process of Reconstruction, Congress
is a Court of Equity, bound to supply deficiencies
in the existing law, to enjoin against threatened wrong,
and generally to see justice done in spite of technicalities.
Here I only follow the best definitions of Equity
from the earliest times. No student can forget that
profound definition by Aristotle,<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> adopted by Grotius<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
also,&mdash;“Equity is the correction of that wherein the
law by reason of its universality is deficient”; nor can
he forget the phrase of Lord Bacon, when he gives it a
higher character still, namely, “The general conscience
of the realm, which is Chancery.”<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> These two philosophers
were each right; for Equity is at once a correction
of law and the voice of conscience. In conformity
with these principles, an ample jurisdiction has been
established, under which, among other things, the powers
of ordinary courts are supplemented by more flexile
methods, the rules of law are prevented from becoming
instruments of injustice, persons are restrained from asserting
doubtful rights in a manner productive of irreparable
damage, and, in the absence of positive law, universal
justice is maintained. It has been a constant
aspiration to bring Law and Equity into harmony.
Lord Chancellor Eldon relates that on one occasion
Lord Chief-Justice De Grey said, he “never liked Equity
so well as when it was like Law”; and he adds,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
“The day before I heard Lord Mansfield say he never
liked Law so well as when it was like Equity.”<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
In the same spirit, Bishop Burnet says of Sir Matthew
Hale:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As great a lawyer as he was, he would never suffer the
strictness of law to prevail against conscience; as great a
chancellor as he was, he would make use of all the niceties
and subtilties in law, when it tended to support right and
equity.”<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such is Equity, and such are the principles which
preside in its courts. No strictness of law can prevail
against conscience. The niceties and subtilties of law
are all to be used in support of right and equity. These
noble and authoritative rules are a pathway of light.
Against all strictness of law conscience must prevail.
If there are niceties and subtilties in the law, let them
all be employed on the side of right and equity. That
is according to reason and the harmonies of the Universe.
It is Equity.</p>

<p>Am I not right, when I now insist that Congress is a
High Court of Equity with Georgia at its bar? It only
remains that it should apply the principles of Equity,
especially supplying deficiencies in the existing law, enjoining
against threatened wrong, and seeing that justice
is done,&mdash;all technicalities to the contrary notwithstanding.
Against all strictness of law conscience must prevail;
and if there are niceties and subtilties in the law,
they must all minister to the completion of Reconstruction.
To this end, the process of Congress must go forth
in such form as will best establish peace and security in
that State under the safeguard of equal laws. With the
execution of this process Georgia will be a republican
government in reality as in name.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>
<p>The assertion of this power is necessary now, not
merely for Georgia, where it will bring peace and security,
but also for the Nation, which will be elevated
in character and strengthened in that unity against
which the Rebellion dashed itself in battle. An ancient
sage has left in perpetual testimony, that the best
government is where an injury to a single citizen is redressed
as an injury to the whole nation. In harmony
with the saying of the sage is the fundamental law that
protection and allegiance are reciprocal, so that the Nation
owes protection in exchange for the allegiance it
receives. The duties of the Nation are correlative with
the duties of the citizen. Are we a Nation? Surely
we are not, if any State can without correction deny
Equal Rights within its border, or in any way imperil
the tranquillity of the Republic. There was a time
when all this might be done with impunity,&mdash;when
a State was permitted to exalt itself above the Nation,&mdash;when
a State determined for itself the standard of
Human Rights,&mdash;when there was one rule of citizenship
at Boston and another at New Orleans, and as
many different rules as there were States,&mdash;when State
Rights were made the protection for all that a State
chose to do, and the turtle, with its impenetrable shell,
was the prototype of a political community constituting
part of the Nation. But this time has passed. A State
can no longer play the turtle; State Rights have ceased
to be a protection for all that a State inclines to do;
there can be but one rule of citizenship in all the
States, being the same in Boston and New Orleans;
no State can determine for itself the standard of Human
Rights; no State can exalt itself above the Nation;
nor can any State without correction deny Equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Rights within its borders, or in any way imperil the
tranquillity of the Republic. The judgments of courts,
the arguments of Senators, with all possible learning
and all possible skill, are impotent against that prevailing
law which places the National Unity and the
Equal Rights of All beneath the safeguard of the Nation.
There they will remain from this time forevermore,
making the Republic more than ever an example
to mankind.</p>

<h2><a name="INCOME_TAX" id="INCOME_TAX"></a>INCOME TAX.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, April 7, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration a Joint Resolution from the
House, with an amendment by the Committee on Finance, declaratory
of the meaning and intention of the law relating to the Income Tax,
Mr. Sumner said,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">I shall make no opposition to the amendment of
the Committee on Finance, as I understand it is
to relieve the Department from a difficulty which has
arisen in the interpretation of a statute; but I desire
to say now&mdash;and I take this earliest opportunity&mdash;that
I think the income tax ought not to be continued
any longer.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling</span> [of New York]. Reëstablished, you mean.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Very well; I accept the amendment
of the Senator from New York: it ought not to be reëstablished.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Scott</span> [of Pennsylvania]. It has expired.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> It has expired. There was an understanding,
when it was established, that it should live
only into the year 1870. It has now reached its natural
death, and no resurrection ought to operate upon it.
An income tax is a war tax. It ought not to be made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
a peace tax. “The medicine of the Constitution should
not become its daily bread.” I am against the continuance
of this tax; and if the occasion required, I would
go forward and assign reasons. But I am unwilling
now to enter into any general discussion of the question,
as it is not directly presented by the proposition
before the Senate; but I hope the Senator from Ohio
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>], who has charge of this bill, and is Chairman
of the Finance Committee, will bear in mind the
radical objection to any reëstablishment of this tax, and
will also bear in mind another important proposition,&mdash;that
the taxes of the country must be reduced. I have
on another occasion, and more than once, said, “Down
with the taxes!”&mdash;and I repeat the cry now. We cannot
do better than to begin with a tax inequitable in its
operation, and which, according to the original understanding
when first adopted, was to end now.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After further debate, in which different Senators participated, Mr.
Sumner spoke again, as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;I should not have said another
word but for the very confident statement made by
my friend, the Senator from Ohio, that at a proper
time he will show the fairness of this tax. Sir, if he
can show its fairness, he will do what no person before
him has ever been able to do,&mdash;what no speaker in
Parliament, no speaker in Congress, no writer on taxation
or political economy has ever been able to accomplish.
The Senator assumes in advance a very considerable
task. Let me commend him to the candid,
absolutely impartial, and authoritative words of Mr.
McCulloch, in his work on Taxation and Funding. We
all know the authority of this writer; none better can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
be adduced. A committee of this body might be well
satisfied, could it have the sanction of this writer. Now
what does he say of the tax on income? One would
think he had listened to my honorable friend on this
question. Of its effects he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would no doubt have the supposed effects, [<i>i. e.</i> be
successful,] could it be fairly assessed. But the practical
difficulties in the way of its fair assessment are not of a
sort that can be overcome. And the truth is, that taxes
on income, though theoretically equal, are in their practical
operation most unequal and vexatious.”<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> Read the paragraph immediately before
that, in which he speaks of the theory of an income tax.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I should rather read a paragraph after
it, with the permission of the Senator. [<i>Laughter.</i>] I
have read the chapter, and I understand it; and there
are words here to which I call the attention of my
friend:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the Legislature has done all that can be done to
make it equal, it will be most unequal.”</p>

</div>

<p>Strong language that!</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“To impose it only on certain classes of incomes, or to impose
it on all incomes, without regard to their origin, is alike
subversive of sound principle. Nothing, therefore, remains
but to reject it, or to resort to it only when money must be
had at all hazards, when the ordinary and less exceptionable
means of filling the public coffers have been tried and exhausted,
and when, as during the late war, Hannibal is
knocking at your gates, and national independence must be
secured at whatever cost. An unreasoning necessity of this
sort is the only satisfactory justification of taxes on property
and income.”<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p>

</div>

<p>This is the voice of Science. It is not the voice of a
political partisan, or of the representative of any Administration
anxious to establish a system of taxation,
but it is the voice of Science itself, speaking by one of
its&mdash;I may say chosen authorities. How can this testimony
be answered? If you come back to an authority
of a different character, take a statesman. The Senator
from California [Mr. <span class="smcap">Casserly</span>] has referred to Sir
Robert Peel, who is known as the modern author of the
income tax; but he has left his testimony behind. I
quote words from different speeches, showing how he
has characterized it. He admitted that it was “a tax
which had hitherto been reserved for time of war”;
and that “the question of its imposition was, whether
the political necessity was of such magnitude and urgency
as to justify it”; and then that it “ought to
be accompanied by measures of simultaneous relief.”
Then, “he did not deny that it was an inquisitorial
tax”; and again, that “a certain degree of inquisitorial
scrutiny was inseparable from an income tax”; and
further, that “a good deal of inconvenience inevitably
arose from the inquiries that must be instituted into
the properties of men, in the imposition of an income
tax”; moreover, that “one great objection to the income
tax was, that it fell with peculiar severity upon
those who were determined to act honestly.”<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>In harmony with his testimony is that also of Mr.
Gladstone, named by the two Senators who have preceded
me. The Senator from Ohio reminds us that Mr.
Gladstone has sustained an income tax. Have we not
all sustained an income tax?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>. He does it this very year.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> This very year, and why? The Senator
knows perfectly how England is pressed by taxation,&mdash;how
difficult it is to find objects for taxation in order
to meet the great demands upon her exchequer. He
knows that England is obliged now, in time of peace,
to meet the responsibilities of war. It is on account
of that terrible war debt which still hangs over her,
the interest of which must be annually paid, that she
is obliged to assume even in a period of peace this
responsibility. I think we are in no such condition.
Our war is happily over, and I know no reason why
the responsibilities and obligations assumed during that
period should be prolonged now during the reign of
peace. Sir, let us put an end to the war. And I know
no better way to give our testimony to the end of the
war than by stopping that taxation which was born of
the war.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, April 8, 1870.</p>

<p class="dropcap">GENTLEMEN,&mdash;You propose to celebrate the triumph
of Equal Rights at the ballot-box, and at
the same time to abandon that famous shibboleth by
which you once rallied the country against Slavery.</p>

<p>It was said of Wolfe, the conqueror at Quebec, that
he died in the arms of Victory; and such will be the
fortune of your noble Society. “They run!” was the
voice that fell on the ears of the expiring General.
“Who run?” he exclaimed. “The enemy,” was the
answer. “Now, God be praised, I shall die in peace,”
said he, and his battle ended.</p>

<p>The Antislavery Society may now die in peace. Slavery
is ended. But I do not doubt that the same courage
and fidelity which through long years warred against
this prodigious Barbarism will continue determined to
the end in protecting and advancing the work begun.</p>

<p>I do not think the work finished, so long as the word
“white” is allowed to play any part in legislation,&mdash;so
long as it constrains the courts in naturalization,&mdash;so
long as it rules public conveyances, steamboats, and railroads,&mdash;so
long as it bars the doors of houses bound by
law to receive people for food and lodging, or licensed as
places of amusement,&mdash;so long as it is inscribed on our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>

the power of the Nation is recognized, supreme and
beyond question, to fix the definition of a “republican
government,” and to enforce the same by the perfect
maintenance of rights everywhere throughout the land,
according to the promises of the Declaration of Independence,
without any check or hindrance from the
old proslavery pretension of State Rights. It must be
understood that every State, while perfectly free in its
local administration, is subject to the supremacy of the
Nation, whenever it touches the Rights of Man,&mdash;so
that, according to the ancient words of Demosthenes,
the law shall be “a general ordinance, <em>equal and alike

<div class="figcenter">

<div class="medium">

<p>The question being on an amendment to the Legislative Appropriation
Bill, reducing the appropriation for the Bureau of Education from
$14,500 to $5,400, in conformity with a previous reduction of the clerical
force, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I hope there may be no hesitation
in refusing to agree to this amendment.
It seems to me that the House of Representatives has
acted wisely in increasing the appropriation, and we
shall act very unwisely, if we fail to unite with the
House. We, Sir, are a Republic; we are living under
republican institutions; and, as I understand them, one
of their essential elements is Education. Now, Sir, here
is an agency associated with the National Government,
having education for its object; and what is the appropriation
proposed by our excellent committee? It is
$5,400: that is all. Looking on the opposite page of
the bill, I find an appropriation of $9,000 for stationery,
furniture, and books for the Interior Department; I find
an appropriation of $16,000 for fuel and lights for the
Interior Department; and yet we propose to give only
$5,400 to create and support a Bureau of Education!
Sir, is that decent? It seems to me, in this age, at this
period of our history, when more than ever we are beginning
to see the transcendent advantage of education,
how much we owe to light,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Hail, holy light!”&mdash;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p class="noindent">it seems to me strange that we should now cut down
the appropriation for the Bureau of Education. Turning
on, I come to the Department of Agriculture, and
there I find an appropriation of $72,170; and then I
turn back again to the $5,400 for the Bureau of Education.
I think the House did not go far enough, when
it made the appropriation $14,500. I would make the
appropriation as large as that for the Agricultural Department;
and I know full well the period is at hand
when all of you will rejoice to make an appropriation
for the Educational Bureau twice more than that for
the Agricultural Department.</p>

<p>As to the question whether there is any existing statute
to sanction this appropriation, I dismiss it entirely.
It is merely a technicality; and it ought not now, on
this Appropriation Bill, at this stage, after the vote of
the House, to be allowed to stand in the way.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sherman, of Ohio, supported the amendment as a step toward
the abolition of the Bureau, which he regarded as useless,&mdash;at the
same time urging the withdrawal, for consideration in a full Senate, of
a proviso, just voted, for the restoration of the original clerical force;
and it being thereupon suggested that the whole matter be passed over
till the next day, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Before that passes away, I wish to make one comment
on a single word of the Senator from Ohio. The
Senator said that he hoped we should take no backward
step; and yet his speech and his proposition were a
backward step. Sir, there is nothing that any State or
any nation can do for education that is not for civilization
itself; and now the Senator from Ohio is against
appropriating a paltry sum of $10,000 for education.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sherman.</span> No,&mdash;for two or three clerks.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> My friend will pardon me,&mdash;for education.
He is against making this paltry appropriation
for education; and he reminds us that in his great State
$3,000,000 are set apart for this purpose. Is it not
shameful, that, while $3,000,000 are set apart for this
purpose in his great State, so small a sum as is now
proposed is to be set apart by the Nation? Am I told
that the Nation has nothing to do with this question?
Allow me to reply at once, it has everything to do with
it; it has more to do with it than the State of Ohio, inasmuch
as in the Nation are all the States. Ohio is
only one State; all the States compose the Nation; and
the Nation is responsible for the civilization of all the
States. The Nation is the presiding genius, not only
of Ohio, but of all the associate States of the Union.
Therefore, Sir, should the Nation by every means in its
power, by appropriation, by a department, by a bureau,
by clerks, by officers, do everything possible to promote
the interests of education.</p>

<p>But the question may be asked, What can it do?
With the sum proposed, unhappily, very little,&mdash;too
little. But let us not give up doing even that little.
A little in such a cause is much. If nothing else, information
may be accumulated, statistics may be gathered,
facts may be brought together, which can be laid
before those interested in education all over our own
country and in foreign lands. That may be a specific
object of the Bureau of Education.</p>

<p>Then, again, it may supply a general impulse to education
in every State,&mdash;even in Ohio, with its $3,000,000
appropriated to that purpose. Permit me to say, the
State of Ohio, great as it is, is not yet above the reach
of educational influences; and I am sure that this Bureau,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
if properly organized, might be of advantage even
to the great State which my friend represents with so
much ability on this floor. I therefore adopt the language
of my friend, when he said, “Let us take no
backward step.” I would increase this appropriation,
rather than diminish it. I wish it were $100,000,&mdash;ay,
Sir, $500,000.</p>

FROM CIVIL OFFICE.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, May 12, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate having under consideration a bill for the reduction of
the Army, reported by Mr. Wilson, of Massachusetts, from the Committee
on Military Affairs, as a substitute for one from the House, and
the pending question being on an amendment by Mr. Trumbull, of Illinois,
restoring to its original form in the House bill the provision
“That it shall not be lawful for any officer of the Army of the United
States on the active list to hold any civil office,” by striking out the
words “on the active list,” Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;There is a principle of our institutions,
to which reference is constantly made
in this debate, which is worthy of constant memory. It
is the subordination of the military to the civil power.
Mr. Jefferson, in his Inaugural Address, so memorable
as a representation of the fundamental principles of republican
institutions, expressly declares the subordination
of the military to the civil an essential element of a
republic. I accept that idea; and I confess that I have
always admired in our system that the Navy Department
and the War Department each is in charge of a
civilian; that neither a naval officer nor a military officer,
in the ordinary course of affairs, takes his place at
the head of either of these Departments, to the end that
the Navy and the Army shall see in a civilian the visible
head of each. In that I recognize the genius of the
Republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>But now, Sir, for the application. I confess I agree
entirely with the argument of the Senator from Ohio
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>]. I consider that the demands of republican
institutions are completely satisfied, if we exclude
men in active service from taking part in civil life. To
go further is to tie the hands of the appointing power,&mdash;to
take from the country the opportunity of securing,
it may be, important service,&mdash;and, I think, is to be
needlessly hard on men who in their day have rendered
good service to the country. It does seem to me that
cases may occur where it may be important to take into
the civil service a retired officer. Why may not that
occur in the natural course of events? There is talent,
there is experience. Are our offices so well filled, is the
public service so completely performed, that we can afford
to exclude talent and experience?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling.</span> Is not that much more true in regard to
active officers?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> There, Sir, you come in conflict with
the fundamental principle of republican institutions.
You cannot, as I submit, fill civil offices from the active
service of the Army or Navy without conflict
with that fundamental principle.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling.</span> Why?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> But I find no such conflict, if you
take an officer on the retired list.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Conkling.</span> Will the Senator point out the distinction?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator asks, “Why?” For the
obvious reason, that, when the officer is on the retired
list, he has, for all the ordinary purposes of the service,
ceased to be an officer,&mdash;he enjoys what I think has
been called a pension, which in reality is a pension
under another name,&mdash;and he has ceased to be in the
active, practical service either of Navy or of Army. On
that account I see a clear distinction.</p>

<p>Therefore it seems to me, for the sake of the public
service, and that we may not be guilty of hardship to
any portion of the community, that the words introduced
by my colleague in the pending bill ought to be
preserved. I hope they will not be struck out.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On the question of an appropriation of $100,000 for “one or more
expeditions towards the North Pole,” moved by Mr. Sumner, under a
resolution of the Committee on Foreign Relations,&mdash;it being objected
by Mr. Morrill, of Vermont, that “we could not afford to embark in
such an enterprise,” that “the money was needed for purposes altogether
more pressing,” Mr. Sumner remarked,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Senator from Vermont has just moved and carried
a large appropriation for the extension and
adornment of the Capitol grounds, and now he opposes
a smaller appropriation having for its object the extension
of geographical knowledge in this hemisphere.
I voted gladly for the proposition of the Senator; but
he does not favor mine. He is against the North Pole.
His mood is not unlike that of Lord Jeffrey, when he
broke forth against it. Somebody, to whom he had
spoken impatiently on the subject, complained to Sydney
Smith of the language he had employed, being
nothing less than “Damn the North Pole!”&mdash;when
the great wit endeavored to soothe the injured man,
saying, “Do not be concerned; I have heard him speak
disrespectfully of the Equator.” I presume the Senator
from Vermont would do the same thing, if there were
any question of exploration under the Equator.</p>

<p>I doubt not that in former days the Senator has
circulated under his frank Herndon’s “Exploration of
the Valley of the Amazon.” Here was an Equatorial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
exploration by which our country has gained honor.
There is nothing in our history by which we have acquired
a better fame than what we have done for science.
The scientific reports on our Western territory
are much valued where science is cultivated. And the
United States Exploring Expedition, organized by the
care of John Quincy Adams, has given to our Republic
a true renown. Who would blot from our annals
this invaluable record? But we, too, may do something
not unworthy of companionship with this early
expedition.</p>

<p>Thus far our Government has attempted nothing for
Polar exploration. Kane and Hayes have added to
our geographical knowledge, and inscribed the names
of honored countrymen on Arctic headlands; but their
expeditions proceeded from private munificence. The
time has come when the Government should take up
this work, nor leave the monopoly to foreign powers.
Perhaps I desire too much; but I would have my country
explore this whole North American Continent, not
only in the interest of science, but for the sake of the
near future. It is easy to see that our Capitol grounds
will be broader than anything included in the amendment
of the Senator from Vermont, and I hope we shall
not delay their exploration.</p>

<p>Nor should we be daunted by difficulties. I cannot
doubt that the time will come when every quarter of
the globe, with every corner, every recess, whether at
the Equator or the Pole, whether land or sea, will be
brought within the domain of knowledge, and find its
place on the map, so that there shall be no <i>Terra Incognita</i>;
but we must do our part in this triumph. Do
not say that this knowledge is without value. Just in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
proportion as we know the earth can we use and enjoy
it. Therefore, for our own advantage and for our good

<h2><a name="ONE_CENT_POSTAGE" id="ONE_CENT_POSTAGE"></a>ONE CENT POSTAGE,
WITH ABOLITION OF FRANKING.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, June 10, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, having under consideration
the House bill “to abolish the franking privilege,” Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;This debate began with a simple
proposition to abolish the franking system,
sometimes called “the franking privilege.” The bill
for this purpose rudely terminates the existing system,
without supplying any substitute, and without taking
advantage of the proposed change to reduce the rate of
postage. The bill is destructive, but in no respect constructive.
It pulls down, but does not pretend to set
up. It abolishes an old and time-honored, if not beneficent
system, under which the people have grown in
knowledge; but it does not attempt to provide any
means by which the original object of the system shall
be accomplished. It is a raw, crude, naked proposition.
To adopt it in its present form would be as if you voted
the destruction of this Capitol, without providing any
place for the meeting of Congress, or economizing the
ruins you made.</p>


<h3>THE FRANKING SYSTEM, AND NOT THE FRANKING
PRIVILEGE, IN OUR COUNTRY.</h3>

<p>In England the power to frank was originally conferred
as a “privilege,” and it assumed this character<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
completely with time. When O’Connell wrote to a
young aspirant, who had just been elected to Parliament,
“You can frank to-night,” he announced a privilege.
So far as this power in our country can be regarded
as a privilege, it has no title to favor,&mdash;not the
least. But whatever may be its character, nothing is
clearer than that it should not be a burden on the
postal service. With regard to the frank there are
two obvious principles: first, so far as it is a privilege,
it must be abolished; and, secondly, so far as it is allowed
to remain, it must not be at the expense of the
Post-Office, but, like other national services, be paid by
the National Treasury. Better still, let it all disappear
in a renovated system, where the rate of postage shall
render the frank unnecessary.</p>

<p>The franking system in our country cannot be treated
alone. It is part of a larger system, being the postal
service of the country, and must be regarded in its relations
to this service. In its most simple statement it
is the freedom of certain letters, documents, pamphlets,
and seeds in the public mails; but its true character
is seen only in its operation. The franking system
is that part of the postal service by which the people
are enabled without cost to address their Senators and
Representatives in Congress, and also the Departments
of Government, while these answer without cost, thus
bringing all near together; it is also that part of the
postal service by which public documents are circulated
throughout the country, and though much is distributed
to little purpose, yet much is of unquestionable
advantage. Seeds, speeches, and pamphlets are
also distributed in the same way; nor can there be any
question of the good influence from this agency. All<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
these are component parts of the existing postal system.
Strike out these, and the postal system of our country
is changed. It is not the system which has existed
from the beginning of our Government, under which the
country has grown in knowledge and power.</p>

<p>To those who speak lightly of the franking system I
indicate briefly what it has done. It has brought the
people and the Government nearer together than people
and Government ever were before. It has distributed
innumerable documents by which knowledge in government,
in science, and in the practical arts has been advanced.
It has lent itself to the dissemination of truth,
especially in speeches; so that it has been preacher
and schoolmaster, with the whole people to hear and
to learn. During the long tyranny of Slavery it was
by the franking system that the arguments and protests
against this wrong were carried among the people;
and when Slavery broke forth in rebellion, the
franking system became the powerful ally of the national
cause; and now in the education of the States
lately in rebellion this very franking system is the same
powerful ally. It may be politic, discreet, and economical
to dispense with it, but not, I think, without providing
some substitute or commutation.</p>


<h3>PROPOSED SUBSTITUTE.</h3>

<p>To meet the exigency of the pending proposition I
have introduced a bill, whose character may be seen
in its title,&mdash;being “to simplify and reduce the rate of
postage, to abolish the franking system, to limit the cost
of carrying the mail, and to regulate the payment of
postage.”<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> While abolishing the franking system, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
try to provide a substitute, and at the same time, by
associate provisions, to simplify and reduce the rate of
postage. Taking advantage of the proposed change, I
would revise the whole postal service, and bring it into
harmony with the demands of republican civilization.
Here the example of England is an important guide.
The franking system there was an indulgence, or privilege,
and little else. The “Quarterly Review,” while
recognizing it as an abuse, likened it to “the concomitant
and greater one which stands on the same ground,&mdash;<em>exemption
from arrest</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> It was not a system important
in the relations between Government and people,
and yet it was abolished only in conjunction with the
establishment of a uniform letter-postage at one penny.
But just in proportion as the franking system is important
with us should its abolition be accompanied by
a corresponding reduction in postage.</p>

<p>The copper unit of value in England is a penny, and
this was adopted as the rate of postage there. With
us the copper unit of value is a cent, and this I would
adopt as the rate of postage here.</p>

<p>There are other provisions in the bill to which I call
attention, especially the new facilities for newspapers
and periodicals; also the requirement that all the business
of the Post-Office shall be by stamps, so that no
money shall be collected or received by any clerk in the
office. By this process, at once simple, economical, and
efficient, all postages will be collected, and there will be
no necessity for accounts. The stamp office will be the
universal money office, and the vendor of stamps will
be the universal collector.</p>

<p>Do you ask for economy? I show you a way, simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
and certain, by which receipts will be assured, while
business is simplified. All dues will be collected at
the minimum of cost, so that there will be no loss from
frauds or supernumerary hands. There will be both security
and economy, besides simplicity; but simplicity
is economy as well as convenience, in the Post-Office as
in mechanics.</p>


<h3>FOREIGN EXAMPLES.</h3>

<p>If we go to foreign countries for example, we shall be
obliged to stop in England. There is nothing in any
nation of the European continent which is not a warning.
Everywhere on that continent, from time immemorial,
postage has been exorbitant. The great Revolution
which popularized the institutions of France did
not popularize the Post-Office. Kings and nobles disappeared,
while equal rights prevailed; but France, fruitful
in ideas, did not conceive the idea of the Post-Office
as a beneficent agent of civilization and the handmaid
of social life. Nor at that time was England in advance
of France. Everywhere postage was high and
the mails were slow. In England the service had a
burden in the circumstance that every peer of the Upper
House and member of Parliament had a defined
power of franking,&mdash;being the power to send ten letters
daily and to receive fifteen.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> As the letters sent
and received by each privileged person were limited in
number, the Post-Office was obliged each day to verify
every frank and to count the letters thus sent and
received. Here was what may be justly called “the
franking privilege,” while the whole postal service was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
costly and cumbersome. Like that of the United States,
it was the growth of accident, and it was administered
with a particular eye to profits, as if this were the first
object of a post-office. Economy there should be always,
but profits never. In Great Britain the surplus
of receipts above the cost of administration was carried
to the general treasury. In the United States the
surplus received on certain lines has been employed
down to this day in extending mail facilities to the
sparse settlers in other parts of the country, besides defraying
the expense of the franking system; and the letters
of the people have been subjected to this tax.</p>


<h3>IN ENGLAND THE POST-OFFICE REGARDED ORIGINALLY
AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE.</h3>

<p>From a proposition submitted to the King in 1635,
and still preserved in the State-Paper Office, it appears
that the postal service was of the slenderest character:
letters, it is said, “being now carried by carriers or
foot-posts sixteen or eighteen miles a day, it is full two
months before any answer can be received from Scotland
or Ireland to London.”<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> But just so soon as it
attracted attention the Post-Office was regarded as a
source of revenue. In 1657 a voice in Parliament
declared that it would “raise a revenue”; while a
wise statesman replied, with little effect, “Nothing can
more assist trade than this intercourse.”<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> It was often
farmed out for hire. The posts, both inland and foreign,
under the Commonwealth, were farmed for £10,000<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
a year.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> In 1659 the Report on the Public Revenue
contains the following item: “By postage of letters in
farm, £14,000.”<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> Under Charles the Second the same
system was continued, and his first Postmaster-General
contracted to pay to the King a yearly rent of £21,500.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
A little later we meet the statute of 15 Charles II. c. 14,
with the suggestive title, “An Act for settling the profits
of the Post-Office on his Royal Highness the Duke
of York and the Heirs male of his body.” Under Queen
Anne, what were called the “cross-posts” were farmed
to Ralph Allen, who made great improvements in their
management upon an agreement that the new profits
so created should be his own during life. The bargain
was so excellent for the contractor that during forty-two
years he netted an average annual profit of nearly
twelve thousand pounds,<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> which was enormous for those
days. It is pleasant to think that the money thus obtained
was well spent, as will be confessed when it is
known that this contractor was the <em>Allworthy</em> of Fielding,
and won from Pope that famous praise,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Let humble Allen, with an awkward shame,</div>
<div class="verse">Do good by stealth, and blush to find it fame.”<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Post-Office was not only farmed to contractors,
but it was burdened with pensions, sometimes to a
royal mistress or favorite. This system was begun by
James the Second, who, in execution of the wishes of
his brother, Charles the Second, granted to Barbara,
Duchess of Cleveland, £4,700 annually, and to the Earl
of Rochester £4,000 annually, payable by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
Post-Office.<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Among the rewards lavished at a later day
upon the Duke of Marlborough was an annual pension
of £5,000, charged upon the Post-Office;<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> so that the
victor of Ramillies and of Blenheim was a stipendiary
upon the correspondence of the kingdom, every letter
contributing to his annual income.</p>

<p>As the correspondence of the kingdom was charged
with pensions, so also was it called to bear the burden
of war. The statute of 9 Anne, c. 10, tells the story in
its title: “An Act for establishing a General Post-Office
for all her Majesty’s dominions, and for settling <em>a weekly
sum out of the revenues thereof for the service of the
war</em> and other her Majesty’s occasions.” This statute
was not short-lived, and its success as “war measure”
encouraged the imposition of other burdens, so that the
great English commentator, Sir William Blackstone, selected
the Post-Office as a favorite pack-horse. “There
cannot be devised,” says he, “a more eligible method
than this of raising money upon the subject; for therein
both the Government and the people find a mutual benefit.
The Government acquires a large revenue; and
the people do their business with greater ease, expedition,
and cheapness than they would be able to do, if no
such tax (and of course no such office) existed.”<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Here
is the rule authoritatively declared which so long prevailed
with regard to the Post-Office.</p>


<h3>ORIGIN OF FRANKING PRIVILEGE IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>The English franking privilege was the natural parasite
of such a system, where the true idea of a post-office<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
was entirely forgotten. Its origin belongs to this argument.
It was in 1657, beneath the sway of the great
Protector, while the Postage Act was before the House,
that Sir Christopher Pack is reported as saying, “The
design of the bill is very good for trading and commerce;
… as to that of letters passing free for members,
it is not worth putting in an Act”;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and this is
the earliest allusion to “letters passing free for members.”
The idea showed itself again just after the Restoration,
while the Act of 12 Charles II., c. 35, was under
discussion. The proposition to frank all letters to
or from members of Parliament during the session was
carried on a division and after considerable debate, in
the course of which Sir Heneage Finch, so eminent as
lawyer and judge, characterized it as “a poor mendicant
proviso, and below the honor of the House.” Among
its partisans was Sir George Downing, a graduate in the
first class of Harvard College. The Speaker, Sir Harbottle
Grimston, was unwilling to put the question, saying,
“I am ashamed of it.”<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> The Lords struck it out of
the bill, ostensibly for the reasons which had actuated
the Opposition in the Commons, but really because there
was no provision that their own letters should pass free.
Although the proposition failed at that time to obtain
legislative sanction, yet the object was accomplished
indirectly. In the indenture with the contractor to
whom the Post-Office was farmed occurred a proviso
for the free carriage of all letters to or from the King,
the great officers of State,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span> “and also the single inland
letters only of the members of the present Parliament
during the continuance of this session of this Parliament.”<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
And thus began the “franking privilege”
in England. Defeated in Parliament, it was smuggled
into a Post-Office contract. With such an origin,
it became a mere perquisite of office; and afterward,
when sanctioned by statute, it was employed at the
mere will of its possessor, who sometimes distributed
his franks among his friends and sometimes sold them
for a price.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>


<h3>POST-OFFICE IN THE COLONIES.</h3>

<p>The postal service in the Colonies was on a small
scale. Authentic incidents show its beginnings. The
Government of New York in 1672 established a post
to go monthly from New York to Boston, advertising
“those that bee dispos’d to send letters, lett them bring
them to the Secretary’s office, where, in a lockt box,
they shall bee preserved till the messenger calls for
them. All persons paying the post before the bagg be
seal’d up.”<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> Thirty years later this monthly post was
fortnightly.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> In Virginia the postal service was more
simple. The Colonial law of 1657 required every planter
to provide a messenger for the conveyance of dispatches,
as they arrived, to the next plantation, and so
forward, on pain of forfeiting a hogshead of tobacco for
each default.<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> Until after 1704 there was no regular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
post further East than Boston, or further West than
Philadelphia. In that year Lord Cornbury, writing to
Government at home, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If I have any letters to send to Virginia, or to Maryland,
I must either send an express, who is often retarded for want
of boats to cross those great rivers they must go over, or else
for want of horses, or else I must send them by some passengers
who are going thither. The least I have known any
express take to go from hence to Virginia has been three
weeks.”<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Shortly afterward stage-coaches were established between
Boston and New York, and between Boston and
Philadelphia; but no post-office was established in Virginia
until 1732; nor did any postal revenue accrue to
Great Britain from the Colonies until 1753, when Benjamin
Franklin became Postmaster-General for the Colonies.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a></p>

<p>The same genius which ruled in philosophy and in
politics was not wanting in this sphere of duty. The
office was remodelled, and the sphere of its operations
extended. But the efforts of Franklin in this department
became tributary to the revenues of the mother
country. On his removal, in 1774, he was able to say,
“Before I was displaced by a freak of the ministers we
had brought it to yield <em>three times as much clear revenue
to the Crown</em> as the Post-Office of Ireland. Since
that imprudent transaction they have received from it&mdash;not
one farthing.”<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Revenue! always revenue! Even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
Franklin shows no sign of ascending to the true idea of
a post-office. The Revolution was now at hand, when
the Crown ceased to receive revenue from any source in
the United States. But in separating from the mother
country the Post-Office was left unchanged in character.
It was an undeveloped agency, with receipts always
above expenses.</p>


<h3>REFORM AND PENNY POSTAGE IN ENGLAND.</h3>

<p>Meanwhile in the mother country the Post-Office
continued to be a source of revenue; but its natural
capacities were impaired by a defective system, without
an animating soul. It was merely a machine for carrying
a few letters and putting money into the public
treasury. Though still on a small scale, its processes
were multifarious. The rates were constantly altered,
and generally increased in amount, as also in number,
in each of the three kingdoms, and without uniformity
in either two. From two or three, in 1710, they rose
in number until they reached the climax of absurdity
and inconvenience in twelve different rates for England
and Scotland in 1812, and thirteen for Ireland in 1814.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a>
The impracticable system, with rates at once numerous
and high, led to perpetual evasions, while the franking
privilege was a charge without an equivalent. At last
the day of revolution came. After careful inquiry the
old system was swept away, and with it no less than
one hundred and fifty Acts of Parliament by which it
was incumbered.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The old was succeeded by the new,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
and the change was complete. No institution in history
ever underwent at once a transformation so beneficent
as that of the British Post-Office.</p>

<p>Next after Benjamin Franklin, Rowland Hill will be
enrolled as the most remarkable character in the history
of the Post-Office. The son of a schoolmaster, of simple
life, and without any connection with the postal service,
he conceived the idea of radical reform. It is not too
much to say that he became the inventor or author of
cheap postage. More than all Franklin did for the Colonies
Hill did for Great Britain. Call him inventor or
author, there are few on either list more worthy of honor;
and since what is done for one country becomes
the common property of the world, he belongs to the
world’s benefactors.</p>

<p>Rowland Hill well observed, that, while population,
business, and all other sources of national revenue had
greatly increased during the preceding twenty years,
the revenue of the Post-Office had actually decreased;
that, for instance, the revenue from stage-coaches had
risen from £217,671 in 1815 to £498,497 in 1835, or
one hundred and twenty-nine per cent., while the postal
revenue, which at a corresponding rate of increase
should have exhibited a gain of £2,000,000, in point of
fact showed an absolute loss of near £20,000, having
declined from £1,557,291 in 1815 to £1,540,300 in
1835.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> Evidently there was something abnormal, when
the conveyance of persons and parcels yielded a revenue
so much beyond that of letters. After showing the
loss to the revenue, the generous reformer demonstrated
clearly that the actual cost of carrying a letter by coach
in the mail from London to Edinburgh, being four hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
miles, was only one thirty-sixth part of a penny,<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>&mdash;from
which it was properly inferred that the actual
difference of expense between transporting a letter one
mile and delivering it and transporting it four hundred
miles and delivering it did not justify a different rate of
postage. His conclusion was, that the large cost of distributing
letters grew out of a complex and multifarious
system, springing especially from many rates,&mdash;that all
this would be superseded, if postage were charged, <em>without
regard to distance, at a uniform rate</em>, and that this
uniform rate should be one penny; and he did not hesitate
to declare that with this change there would be an
increase in correspondence “at least five and a quarter
fold.”<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> In his original proposition, Rowland Hill relied
especially upon a uniform rate at a penny, regardless of
distance,&mdash;and from this promised simplicity, economy,
and an immense increase of correspondence. But, offensive
as the franking privilege had become, and burdensome
to the postal service, he did not at first propose its
excision.</p>

<p>His plan encountered that honest opposition which
improvement of all kinds is obliged to overcome. The
record is most instructive. The Postmaster-General,
Lord Lichfield, said in the House of Lords: “Of all
the wild and visionary schemes which I have ever
heard of, it is the most extravagant.” On another occasion
the same high official assured the House, that, if
the anticipated increase of letters should be realized,
“the mails will have to carry twelve times as much in
weight; and therefore the charge for transmission, instead
of £100,000, as now, must be twelve times that
amount. The walls of the Post-Office would burst; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
whole area in which the building stands would not be
large enough to receive the clerks and the letters.”<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> In
the same spirit with his chief, Colonel Maberly, the experienced
Secretary of the Post-Office, in his testimony
before the Committee, did not hesitate to say: “It appears
to me a most preposterous plan, utterly unsupported
by facts, and resting entirely on assumption.”
And he proceeded to predict a loss of revenue from its
adoption, saying, that, if postage were reduced to one
penny, the revenue “would not recover itself for forty
or fifty years.”<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> The London “Quarterly Review,” with
its habitual obstructiveness, set itself against the new
plan and its promised result, saying: “Common sense
is astounded at such a result and refuses to believe it,
though it cannot at first sight discover where the fallacies
lie; but a little examination will show, that, as
usual, common sense is right, even against the assumed
accuracy of arithmetic.”<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> I give these as illustrative
examples of the opposition encountered.</p>

<p>Against all these stood Rowland Hill, insisting that
the Post-Office, although now “rendered feeble and inefficient
by erroneous financial arrangements,” in contemplation
of the proposed reform “assumes the new
and important character of a powerful engine of civilization,
capable of performing a distinguished part in the
great work of national education.”<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a></p>

<p>The proposed reform was vindicated as practical and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
valuable, first by witnesses before the Parliamentary
Committee, and then in Parliamentary debate. The
Committee examined no less than eighty-nine witnesses.
These were from every rank and nearly every
trade and profession,&mdash;peers of the realm, members of
the House of Commons, authors, publishers, merchants,
bankers, mechanics, common carriers, clergymen, solicitors,
Post-Office officials, and others. Among the witnesses
were Richard Cobden, Charles Knight, Rowland
Hill, Dionysius Lardner, and Lord Ashburton.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> The
testimony embraced eleven thousand six hundred and
fifty-four questions and answers, and filled three large
folio volumes bound in two, making altogether nearly
sixteen hundred pages. The Index alone makes one
hundred and fifty-three pages.</p>

<p>Among the many things testified before the Committee
I select the words of Lord Ashburton, as especially
valuable. Experienced in business and in public life,
he pictures truthfully the burden of excessive postage,
when he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think it is one of the worst of our taxes. We have, unfortunately,
many taxes which have an injurious tendency;
but I think few, if any, have so injurious a tendency as the
tax upon the communication by letters.”</p>

</div>

<p>And then again:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is, in fact, taxing the conversation of people who live
at a distance from each other. The communication of letters
by persons living at a distance is the same as a communication
by word of mouth between persons living in the same
town. You might as well tax words spoken upon the Royal
Exchange as the communications of various persons living
in Manchester, Liverpool, and London. You cannot do it
without checking the disposition to communicate very essentially.”</p>

</div>

<p>At the same time Lord Ashburton hesitated to adopt
a rate as low as one penny. He was for twopence or
threepence.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p>The doubts of Lord Ashburton as to the rate were encountered
by Mr. Cobden, who testified:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I consider the only way to produce the greatest possible
amount of revenue is to charge the lowest possible trading
profit; and it is in the Post-Office as in steamboats, or Paddington
coaches, or calicoes, or sugars, or teas, or anything
else which can be or ought to be an article of universal demand
and consumption. With that view I have regarded
Mr. Rowland Hill’s plan of Post-Office Reform; and taking
the cost of a letter, upon the presumed increase he has stated,
even at three-fourths of a penny each letter, I should say one
penny would then be a proper charge ultimately to produce
the greatest possible amount of revenue. I would reason
from analogy and experience in every other business, and in
none more than my own.”<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On such a point nobody could speak with more authority
than Mr. Cobden.</p>

<p>But nobody showed more comprehension of the moral
ground for this reform than Mr. Jones Loyd, the eminent
banker and economist, afterwards Lord Overstone.
Nothing can be better than this:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I think, if there be any one subject which ought not to
have been selected as a subject of taxation, it is that of inter-communication
by post; and I would even go a step further,
and say, that, if there be any one thing which the Government
ought, consistently with its great duties to the public,
to do gratuitously, it is the carriage of letters. We build national
galleries, and furnish them with pictures; we propose
to create public walks, for the air and health and exercise of
the community, at the general cost of the country. I do not
think that either of those, useful and valuable as they are to
the community, and fit as they are for Government to sanction,
is more conducive to the moral and social advancement
of the community than the facility of intercourse by post.
<em>I therefore greatly regret that the post was ever taken as a field
for taxation</em>, and should be very glad to find, that, consistently
with the general interests of the revenue, which the
Government has to watch over, they can effect any reduction
in the total amount so received, or any reduction in the
charges, without diminishing the total amount.”<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

</div>

<p>In all the voluminous testimony this beautiful passage
is like a beacon-light.</p>

<p>At last this important subject was transferred from
the Committee to Parliamentary debate; and here I
content myself with a few brief words from leading
speakers. Mr. Goulburn, one of the chiefs of Opposition,
admitted that the plan proposed would “ultimately
increase the wealth and prosperity of the country.”<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
Mr. Wallace declared it “one of the greatest boons that
could be conferred on the human race.”<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> Sir Robert
Peel admitted that “great social and commercial advantages
will arise from the change, independent of financial
considerations.”<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> Viscount Sandon, of the Opposition,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
struck a higher chord, when he declared that he
“had long been of opinion that the Post-Office was not
a proper source of revenue,” but “ought to be employed
to stimulate other sources of revenue.”<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In the same
strain, and with higher authority, Mr. O’Connell declared
it “one of the most valuable legislative reliefs
that had ever been given to the people”; that it was
“impossible to exaggerate its importance”; and even if
it would not pay the expense of the Post-Office, he held
that “Government ought to make a sacrifice for the purpose
of facilitating communication.”<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> I group these testimonies
as important in the history of this reform, and
furnishing a guide for us.</p>


<h3>VICTORY.</h3>

<p>At last victory was assured. The Parliamentary
Committee reported in favor of change. But Parliament
hesitated to fix the change in permanent form.
By Act of 17th August, 1839, the Lords of the Treasury
were empowered by warrant under their hands to declare
the rates of postage according to weight, “without
reference to the distance or number of miles the same
shall be conveyed,”&mdash;and also to suspend, wholly or in
part, “any parliamentary or official privilege of sending
and receiving letters by the post free of postage, or any
other franking privilege of any description whatsoever.”
The Lords of the Treasury were contented with ordering
a uniform rate of fourpence, and without the abolition
of the franking privilege. This was not enough. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
people called for more, and the Lords of the Treasury
by another warrant declared the rate at one penny and
suspended the franking privilege.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> This was followed
by the Act of Parliament passed 10th August, 1840, in
which the great change was consummated. The rate
was established at one penny, with stamps; and the
franking privilege was abolished, except in the case of
petitions to the Crown or to Parliament not exceeding
thirty-two ounces in weight. The clause of abolition
was as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That, except in the cases herein specified, all privileges
whatsoever of sending letters by the post free of postage, or
at a reduced rate of postage, shall wholly cease and determine.”<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The abolition of the franking privilege was more than
Rowland Hill had proposed. In his testimony before
the Parliamentary Committee he undertook to account
for the anticipated increase of letters “in some measure
from the <em>partial voluntary disuse</em> of the franking
privilege,”<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a>&mdash;thus mildly forecasting, not its abolition,
but its voluntary renunciation. And the Committee, in
their recommendations, treated its abolition as incident
to cheap postage. This is their language:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would be politic, … <em>if, on effecting the proposed
reduction of the postage rates</em>, the privilege of Parliamentary
franking were to be abolished, and the privilege of official
franking placed under strict limitation,&mdash;petitions to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
Parliament and Parliamentary documents being still allowed
to go free.”<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus was the abolition of the franking privilege announced
as subordinate to the reduction of the postage
rates, which was the main object.</p>

<p>Thus, after inquiry and debate lasting for three years,
this great reform was accomplished, and the English
Post-Office assumed an unprecedented character. The
new system was founded on a uniform rate for uniform
weight without regard to distance, and this rate the
lowest unit of coin,&mdash;with prepaid stamps, and the abolition
of the franking privilege. The experiment was
a prodigious success, although the first results showed
a falling off financially. The Post-Office authorities
had predicted that it would not pay expenses; but the
diminished receipts were more than enough for the
expenses, while the number of letters was more than
doubled.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> There was a smaller net revenue for the National
Treasury, but an infinite benefit to the people.
The surplus of the first year was £500,789, against
£1,633,764 of the previous year.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> But the improvement
financially was constant, so that here Rowland
Hill became a prophet. He had predicted that the
increase of correspondence and the economy of management
would in a reasonable time afford a probable
net revenue of £1,278,000.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> In 1856 the net revenue
had reached £1,207,725,&mdash;while at the same time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
letters were 478,393,803 in number, with 6,178,982
money orders, against 75,907,572 letters, with 188,921
money orders, in the last year of the old system.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>The smallest part of the result was in the revenue,&mdash;except
so far as this was advanced by the increased activity
of the country, represented by the added millions
of correspondence. Commerce and business were quickened
infinitely, while the ties of social life were brightened
and the heart was rejoiced. Here the testimony
is complete. Tradesmen wrote to Rowland Hill, their
benefactor, saying how their business had increased.
Charles Knight, the eminent publisher, who did so
much for the literature of the people, wrote that every
branch of bookselling was stimulated, while the country
seller was brought into almost daily communication
with the London houses. The publisher of the Polyglot
Bible in twenty-four languages, requiring a peculiar
revision, declared that it could not have been printed
but for penny postage. The Secretary of the Parker
Society, composed of Church dignitaries and influential
laymen, which has done so much for ecclesiastical literature
by reprinting the works of the early English Reformers,
stated that without penny postage the Society
could not have come into existence. Secretaries of other
societies, literary and benevolent, wrote how their
machinery had been improved; conductors of educational
establishments testified that people were everywhere
learning to write for the first time, in order to
enjoy the benefits of untaxed correspondence, and that
night classes of adults for this purpose were springing
up in all large towns. A leading advocate for the repeal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
of the Corn Laws gave it as his opinion that this
reform must have waited but for penny postage,&mdash;that
through this ally it reached its triumph two years earlier
than it otherwise could have done. All this is easy
to believe; for penny postage lends itself to all knowledge
and to every reform. Others wrote with rapture
of its operations. The accomplished naturalist, Professor
Henslow, of Cambridge, rejoiced over its “importance
to those who cultivate science,” and pictured the
satisfaction of the humble people about his country parsonage
“at the facility they enjoy of now corresponding
with distant relatives,” together with what he calls “the
vast domestic comfort which the penny postage has added
to homes like my own, situate in retired villages.”
Miss Martineau described its social benefits. Rowland
Hill himself, showing how much it had done for the
poor, said, “The postman has now to make long rounds
through humble districts where heretofore his knock
was rarely heard.”<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> And from the outlying Shetland
Islands a visitor in May, 1842, reported: “The Zetlanders
are delighted with penny postage. The postmaster
told me that the number of letters was astonishing.”<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
But perhaps the heartfelt exultation was never better
expressed than by the accomplished traveller, Mr.
Laing, when, after describing the Prussian system of
education, and giving the palm to penny postage as “a
much wiser and more effective educational measure,”
destined to be “the great historical distinction of the
reign of Victoria I.,” he proceeds to say, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span> “every
mother in the kingdom, who has children earning their
bread at a distance, lays her head upon her pillow at
night with a feeling of gratitude for this blessing.”<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a>
Such was the unbought tribute from all quarters,&mdash;alike
the cottage of the lowly and the home of the
professor, the counting-house of the merchant and the
activities of benevolence, business in its various forms,
and the commanding efforts of the political reformer,
all, all confessing their debt to penny postage.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The benefactor was honored in no common way, but
not without tasting the lot of others who have served
Humanity. At first assigned to a position in the Treasury
connected with the Post-Office, then dismissed, and
then, with a change of Administration, not only restored
to the service, but appointed to a high position in the
Post-Office itself, he had the inexpressible satisfaction
of witnessing the triumph of his efforts and receiving
the grateful regard of a happy people. He was not rich,
and the considerable sum of £13,000 was presented to
him by a public subscription throughout the country,
with an address declaring the reform he had accomplished
“the greatest boon conferred in modern times
on all the social interests of the civilized world.” The
knighthood bestowed by his sovereign was another attestation
of his prevailing merit, destined to be followed
by a further gift from Parliament itself of £20,000.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a>
This episode of honor and gratitude to the benefactor
has a peculiar interest for us, as furnishing new testimony
to the cause with which the name of Rowland
Hill is forever associated.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<h3>THE SAME VICTORY MAY BE OURS.</h3>

<p>Such was the great reform by which the Post-Office
became an evangel of civilization; but all this may be
ours. The impediments overcome were greater than
any we are called to encounter, while the object proposed
is in undoubted accord with republican institutions,
where simplicity, harmony, and adaptation to
popular needs are acknowledged principles. This renovation
prevailed in England: how can it fail in the
United States? The Republic is the most advanced
type of government, as the human form is the most advanced
type of the animal world; but the Republic is
nothing else than an organization to promote the welfare
of men. Whatever makes for human welfare is essentially
republican. Nor can any loss of revenue be
set against this transcendent opportunity. Show me
how to promote the welfare of men, and I show you
an economy beyond any revenue; more still, I show
you a duty not to be postponed.</p>

<p>The ruling principle in England, from the beginning
down to the triumph of penny postage, was revenue;
and this is still the ruling principle with us, to which
all else is subordinated. England was accustomed to
say, and the United States now say, with Shylock, “We
would have moneys.” The abolition of the franking
system is proposed on this ground,&mdash;not to lighten
the existing burden of correspondence, not to cheapen
postage, not to simplify the postal service, not to provide
the American equivalent of the English penny
postage, but simply to increase the revenue. We are
summoned to give up a long-tried system, educational<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
in its influence, merely for the sake of the Treasury.
This is the object perpetually in view. Even the Postmaster-General,
who is so liberal in all his ideas, says,
in words which hardly do justice to the times, “As far
as lay in my power, during my short administration, I
have reduced the expenditures and increased the revenues
of the Department.”<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> Something better than this
remains to be done.</p>


<h3>COMPLEXITY AND MULTIFARIOUSNESS IN OUR SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>The postal system of the United States was kindred
in character to that of England until the latter was
transfigured by the felicitous genius of Rowland Hill.
Both had the same incongruities and incumbrances.
The rates in both were complex instead of uniform,
and dear instead of cheap. The Act of Congress, February
20, 1792, establishing the Post-Office, provided for
no less than nine different rates of postage, viz.,&mdash;six,
eight, ten, twelve and a half, fifteen, seventeen, twenty,
twenty-two, and twenty-five cents,&mdash;according to distance.
In 1799 the number of rates was reduced to
six, viz.,&mdash;eight, ten, twelve and a half, seventeen, twenty,
and twenty-five cents. In 1816 the number was
further reduced to five, viz.,&mdash;six, ten, twelve and a
half, eighteen and a half, (in 1825 changed to eighteen
and three fourths,) and twenty-five cents,&mdash;and so continued
until 1845, when, yielding partially to the English
example, the rates were established at five and ten
cents, with two cents for drop letters; then, in 1851, at
three and six cents for prepaid and five and ten cents<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
for unpaid letters, with one cent for drop letters; then,
in 1855, at three and ten cents prepaid, and one cent for
drop letters; then, in 1863, at three cents, or, failing
prepayment, six cents, with two cents for drop letters;
and finally, in 1865, at three cents prepaid in all cases,
with two cents for drop letters delivered by carriers, or
one cent where there is no delivery.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>The difference between a drop letter and what is
called a mailed letter, or letter from post-office to post-office,
causes frequent confusion, as is seen here in
Washington, where letters for Georgetown often have
the two-cent stamp, when they should have that of
three cents. The same confusion exists in other places.
But this ridiculous division and subdivision are peculiar
to the United States. It is not known that they
are to be found in any other postal service.</p>

<p>The rates on foreign letters were, if possible, more
chaotic. It was different with different countries, according
to existing treaties; and this difference prevailed
not only in the rate, but also in the unit of
weight. As late as 1849 the rate on letters to England
and Ireland was twenty-four cents, and was then
changed to sixteen cents, and in 1868 to twelve cents;
it is now six cents, being two cents for the sea postage
and two cents for the inland postage of each country,
allowing half an ounce of weight.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> The treaty rate
with France is fifteen cents on one quarter of an ounce.<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a>
Letters to Canada and other British North American
provinces, when not over three thousand miles, are six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
cents for each half-ounce, if prepaid, and ten cents, if
not prepaid; when over three thousand miles, ten cents;
to Newfoundland, ten cents.<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> Then, in the absence of
postal international convention, there is a general provision
by Act of Congress establishing the rate of ten
cents for each half-ounce carried to or received from
foreign countries “by steamships or other vessels regularly
employed in the transportation of the mails.”<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>Such are the complexity and multifariousness of our
postal service,&mdash;at least three different rates on inland
letters, with an unknown variety on foreign letters.
Here is discord where there should be uniformity, and
out of this discord springs necessarily embarrassment
with untold expense. True, much has been done; but
much remains to be done before the service will have
that simplicity without which it is vain to expect the
desired combination of utility and economy. Every departure
from uniformity is an impediment and an expense.
It is with the postal service as with all else in
Nature and Art: it is efficient and economical in proportion
as it is simple. The rates of postage should be
uniform. Borrowing a phrase from our political victories,
<em>all letters should be equal before the law</em>.</p>

<p>Take by way of illustration the increased perplexity
from two rates: and here I follow an old official of the
Post-Office, Pliny Miles, who puts this very case. “Suppose,”
says he,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span> “city or local letters were two cents, and
letters for a distance three or four cents. What a vast
amount of labor and inconvenience in the work of rating
and sorting in the Post-Office, and how perplexing
to the citizen!”<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> By the existing system there is a
double perplexity,&mdash;first, for the citizen, and, secondly,
for the postal service. Each rate is like an additional
language to be learned, while the unknown rates on foreign
letters are like the confusion of Babel.</p>


<h3>UNIFORM RATE AT ONE CENT.</h3>

<p>In the process of simplification the uniform rate
should be the lowest unit of coin. Beyond the sufficiency
of this rate as a protection of the Post-Office
against abuse, and also its obvious convenience, is its
cheapness, reducing the tax on correspondence to its
practical minimum. In England the penny was the
lowest unit of coin, being in the English currency what
the cent is in ours. The success of the English experiment
is our best encouragement. There is better reason
for the cent as a proper rate in our country than there
was for the penny as a proper rate in England.</p>

<p>Such a rate will be so near to <em>free postage</em> for all, that
it may be considered such practically. Let it be adopted,
and free postage will become the companion of free
school, free lecture, and free library, constituting the
mighty group of republican civilization. The existing
franking system will naturally disappear in this new
franking system for all.</p>

<p>Here we encounter the financial question, What will
be the effect on the Treasury? Will it pay? These
are the potential words. This is the touchstone. That
it will pay in beneficent influence tenfold, ay, Sir, a
hundred-fold,&mdash;that it will make the Post-Office more
than ever the powerful agent of human improvement,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
I cannot doubt. What is a little revenue, compared
with such a result? What, even, is a deficit, with
such a compensation? But looking at the financial
question, and forgetting for a moment the incalculable
good, it will be found that there are general laws of
profit on small prices applicable to this proposed reduction,
reinforced also by the example of England, and
even of our own country.</p>


<h3>REDUCTION OF PRICE INCREASES CONSUMPTION.</h3>

<p>Nothing is plainer, as a general rule, than that the
reduction of price tends to increase of consumption.
This is illustrated by a thousand instances. Thus, at
one time in England the fall in the price of soap one
eighth increased the consumption one third; the fall of
tea one sixth increased consumption one half; the fall
of silks one fifth doubled the consumption; the fall of
coffee one fourth trebled it; and the fall of cotton goods
one half quadrupled it.<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> The circulation of newspapers
and the number of advertisements are governed by the
same law. There is another English instance, not within
the range of ordinary business, which is not without
historic interest. Formerly the admission fee to the famous
sights of the Tower of London was two shillings,
at which rate there were, during the year ending April
30, 1838, 11,104 visitors, paying £1110 8<i>s.</i> The fee
was then reduced to one shilling, and during the twelve
months following (1838-9) there were 42,212 visitors,
paying £2110 12<i>s.</i> On the first of May, 1839, the fee
was again reduced to sixpence, and during the ensuing
year (1839-40) there were 84,872 visitors, paying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
£2121 16<i>s.</i>,&mdash;and the next year (1840-41) 94,973
visitors, paying £2374 6<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i><a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> Thus at the Tower
more people were gratified by the sights and more
money was taken,&mdash;so that there was at the same
time a larger accommodation and a larger revenue. A
reduction of the fee in the ratio of four to one was followed
by an increase of visitors in the ratio of more
than eight to one. According to a familiar story in
our own country, the exhibitor of a panorama reported
to the proprietor that the proceeds at twenty-five cents
a ticket did not pay expenses. “Put it down to ten
cents,” was the reply. This was done, and immediately
the receipts rose so as to give a profit of one hundred
dollars a week.</p>

<p>Such instances as these occurring in business and in
life led Rowland Hill to assert that “the increase in
consumption is inversely as the squares of the prices”;
and this rule justified the expectation, that, with the
proposed reduction of letter postage from the average
of sixpence to a penny, the number of letters would increase
thirty-six fold.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> If the number did not increase
in this remarkable ratio, yet it was such as to disappoint
the enemies of reform. It appears that the estimated
number of chargeable letters delivered in the
United Kingdom of England, Scotland, and Ireland in
1839, the year immediately preceding the first general
reduction of postage, was 75,907,572, and in 1840, the
first year of penny postage, 168,768,344, showing an
increase in one year of more than 122 per cent. Since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
then this large number has dilated year by year, until
in 1867 it amounted to 774,831,000.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>Postal facilities have from the beginning promoted
correspondence, and this was recognized even before
the appearance of Rowland Hill. An old account of
the English Post-Office, after describing certain improvements,
exults “that there is no considerable market-town
but hath an easy and certain conveyance for
the letters thereof to and from the Grand Office in the
City of London, in the due course of the mails every
post”; and then adds, that, “though the number of
letters missive in England were not at all considerable
in our ancestors’ days, yet it is now prodigiously
great, since the meanest people have generally learnt to
write.”<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> This is the language of another age; but it attests
the stimulation which letters receive from opportunity,
and illustrates the value of cheap postage.</p>


<h3>CHEAP POSTAGE MULTIPLIES LETTERS.</h3>

<p>The experience of England is reproduced in the United
States, so far as we have ventured upon postage reform.
Every reduction of rate has been followed by a
corresponding increase in the number of letters. There
was the law of 1845, by which postage was reduced to
two principal rates of five and ten cents. At this proposition,
which erred only in its feebleness, there was
the gloomiest foreboding of utter loss to the Post-Office.
The raven did not croak more hoarsely at the entrance
of Duncan under the battlements of Macbeth. Mr.
McDuffie, the excitable Senator from South Carolina,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
always sensitive for Slavery, after expressing regret
that bodily infirmity disabled him from declaring the
strength of his convictions in regard to the evils which
would flow from this measure, protested against its
adoption as “more radical and revolutionary than anything
ever done in Congress.” The Senator denounced
it as most unjust, and predicted that in ten years the
Post-Office would cost the Treasury $10,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The
newspaper press, though not so fervid, was as skeptical
as the South Carolina Senator; and the Postmaster-General
showed the very disposition which had given
to his brother officials in England the designation of
“unwilling horses.” In his first Report after the passage
of the law, he announced a prospective deficiency
for the current year exceeding $1,250,000, and, unless
there should be some amendment of the law, another
deficiency the next year of little short of $1,000,000.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a>
Now mark the result of even this too slight reduction.
The actual deficiency for 1845-6 was only $597,097,<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
and for 1846-7 it was but $33,677,<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> while in 1848-9
there was a surplus revenue of $226,127.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> The letters
in 1845 were estimated at 39,958,978; and in 1849 at
60,159,862,<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> showing an increase in four years of more
than fifty per cent.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span></p>

<p>Every reduction of postage in our country exhibits
similar results. According to the ratio of reduction has
been the ratio of increase in the number of letters. It
may surprise Senators to know, that, while the estimated
number in 1852 was 95,790,524,<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> it reached in 1868
to 488,000,000, in the estimate of the Post-Office.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> But
this is only according to the prevailing impulsion from
a reduction in price. In England, where the rate was
smaller, the number of letters was much larger, being
in 1867, as estimated, no less than 774,831,000.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> This
becomes more remarkable, when it is considered that
the estimated population of the United States at the
time was more than forty millions, while that of the
United Kingdom was thirty millions,&mdash;making twelve
letters annually for each person in the United States,
and twenty-six letters annually for each person in the
United Kingdom.</p>


<h3>ILLEGITIMATE BURDENS ON CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

<p>To understand the justice of the proposed reduction
in our country, we must analyze and consider existing
obligations of the postal service. I mention two,
through which we may see the unjust operation of the
present tax on correspondence: first, the well-known
franking system, and, secondly, the millions of newspapers,
by which an inconceivable amount of mail matter
is made a burden on the Post-Office, tasking its
transportation and its means of delivery. Although
printed matter, unfranked, is charged with postage, it
is not in proportion to its burden on the postal service;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
so that the letter not only pays for itself, but contributes
to the other. The letter, so small in dimension and
weight, but with its own unseen freight of business or
friendship, is made to carry an additional load. Every
letter is a dwarf shouldering a giant; or stating the case
with absolute literalness, it is a sheet of paper compelled
to bear free matter and printed matter measured
by the ton. This little messenger, whose single function
necessarily requires dispatch, is charged with this
intolerable mass. No wonder that it staggers under
the load heaped upon it. No wonder that the people
are obliged to pay high postage; for, on receiving a letter,
they not only pay the price of its transportation
and delivery, but they contribute to the transportation
and delivery of everything else carried by the mails.</p>

<p>But even this burden could be borne, if the whole
service were not charged with the cost of transportation
and postal facilities in distant parts of the country,
where there is necessarily a disproportionate expense,&mdash;so
that a letter in certain States, after paying
for its own transportation and delivery, and contributing
to the transportation and delivery of free matter
and printed matter, contributes still further to those
long lines of service by which the most remote places
are supplied and the post-office follows close in the
footsteps of the pioneer. This is beautiful, but it is
not just; in other words, it is beautiful that these opportunities
should be afforded, but it is not just that
the correspondence of others should pay for them. Nor
should these extraordinary expenses be charged on these
remote places, or on the pioneer. They belong properly
to the necessary outlay in opening the country, by
which the nation, the great untaxed proprietor, finds a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
market for its land and new scope for its growing empire.
Obviously this outlay should be charged to the
Treasury, rather than saddled upon the postal service,
as it is now.</p>


<h3>EXPENSE OF OUTLYING ROUTES.</h3>

<p>The last Report of the Postmaster-General shows the
operation of the existing system in this respect. By the
Statement of Receipts and Expenditures for 1868-9, it
appears that in no less than sixteen States and Territories,
including the District of Columbia, the Post-Office
was more than self-supporting, there being an excess of
receipts over expenditures of $3,571,315; while in the
other States and Territories there was an excess of expenditures
over receipts amounting to $4,727,175.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The
self-supporting list, with each surplus, is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Here I ask confidently, considering the nature of the
Post-Office and the unquestionable importance of encouraging
correspondence, if it is just that the letter-writers
in one part of the country should be constrained
to make the large contribution attested by this table,
for the benefit especially of those at a distance, and
also of the country at large. Rejecting again all idea of
casting this expenditure upon the distant places and the
pioneer, I insist that it should be borne by the Treasury
rather than by remote letter-writers.</p>

<p>It is easy to exhibit the extent of this charge, and its
palpable injustice. Begin with an illustration. Suppose
a common carrier, with an interest beyond his business
in an undeveloped part of the country at some
distance from his daily line, makes a deviation to this
outlying settlement at a daily loss, but looking to the
growth of his interest there for ultimate remuneration.
It would not be just for him to levy on all his customers
along the main line for the expense of this deviation,&mdash;making
them not only pay for their parcels, but
contribute to the development of the outlying settlement.
Nor would this enforced contribution commend
itself, if urged in the name of charity or as a patriotic
service to an infant community. The customers would
insist that their parcels should pay only the legitimate
cost of transportation and delivery; or they would soon
find another carrier, who would charge them simply for
their parcels, without adding the cost of opening new
settlements. But the National Government is our common
carrier, turning aside at great expense to develop
and supply new places, to its great ultimate advantage
in the sale of public lands, the growth of population,
and increase of the revenue; but it is not justified in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
casting this large expense on the correspondence of the
people.</p>

<p>Already the Nation assumes the expenses of the
Territories before their admission as States, paying the
salaries of their various officers and the cost of administration.
For equal reason the Nation should assume
the expenses of these outlying post-routes.</p>

<p>By the kindness of the Postmaster-General I am enabled
to present from the records of the Department
two authentic testimonies. There is the post-route from
San Antonio to El Paso, a distance of seven hundred and
four miles, with the annual cost of service, $126,601,
and the annual receipts from offices on the route, $3,137.
There is also the post-route from Kelton, Utah, to the
Dalles, Oregon, seven hundred and sixty-five miles, with
the annual cost of service, $130,278, and the annual receipts
from offices on the route, $3,822. Other instances
might be adduced, but these are enough to show
how seriously the postal service is burdened by obligations
which plainly belong to the Treasury.</p>

<p>In former debates of the Senate, an incident was
mentioned by Mr. Crittenden, of Kentucky,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> which
illustrates the character of these unproductive lines.
During a journey in Tennessee in the summer of 1844,
the Senator had occasion to go to an outlying post-office
in the interior of the State, on reaching which, late at
night, he found the postmaster had gone to bed, leaving
the mail-bags in the wagons. To his inquiries concerning
this singular circumstance, “Why, Sir,” responded
the official,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span> “we don’t take the bags out at all; we don’t
even look into them; it is so seldom we receive anything,
we don’t think it worth while.” And upon investigation
it in fact appeared that there was not a
letter in any one of these bags, and had not been for a
month. But this costly mail-service was at the expense
of the correspondence elsewhere. The letter of the distant
seaboard was a contributor.</p>


<h3>DISTANCE ALONE DOES NOT CAUSE EXPENSE.</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is supposed that the great distances of
our country cause the large expense; but this is a mistake,
founded on superficial observation. The large expense
proceeds from something besides distance. Here
I quote the words of Rowland Hill:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It is not matter of inference, but a matter of fact, that
the expense to the Post-Office is practically the same, whether
a letter is going from London to Barnet [eleven miles] or
whether it is going from London to Edinburgh [four hundred
miles]; the difference is not expressible in the smallest
coin we have.”<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a></p>

</div>

<p>I have already mentioned that the actual cost of transportation
from London to Edinburgh was only one thirty-sixth
of a penny, and this was the average for all letters
throughout the United Kingdom. With so small
a fraction of a penny representing the cost of the longest
line, it was apparent that the element of distance
must be eliminated from the question. A recent writer
thus strongly testifies to this rule:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If Mr. Hill demonstrated one thing more plainly than
another, it was that the absolute cost of the transmission of
each letter was so infinitesimally small, that, if charged according
to that cost, the postage could not be collected. Besides,
it is not certain that the one letter would cost the
Post-Office more than the other.”<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But this rule is as applicable in our country as in the
United Kingdom, always provided the lines are productive.</p>

<p>This rule, first enunciated by Rowland Hill, was
substantially adopted by the Parliamentary Committee,
when they say,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it is the opinion of this Committee, that that part of
the inland postage on letters <em>which consists of tax</em> ought to be
the same on all; that, as the cost of conveyance per letter
depends more on the number of letters carried than on the
distance which they are conveyed, the cost being frequently
greater for distances of a few miles than for distances of hundreds
of miles, the charge, if varied in proportion to the cost,
ought to increase in the inverse ratio of the number of letters
conveyed; but as it would be difficult, if not impossible, to
carry such a regulation into practice, and as the actual cost of
conveyance (assuming the charged letters to bear the whole
expense of the franked letters and of the newspapers) forms
less than the half of the whole charge exclusive of tax, the
remaining portion consisting chiefly in the charges attendant
on their receipt at and delivery from the Post-Office, your
Committee are of opinion that the nearest practicable approach
to a fair system would be to charge a uniform rate of
postage between one post-town and another, whatever might
be their distance; and your Committee are further of opinion
that such an arrangement is highly desirable, not only on
account of its abstract fairness, but because it would tend in
a great degree to simplify and economize the business of the
Post-Office.”<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>All this is plainly reasonable, whether in the United
Kingdom or the United States.</p>

<p>The actual cost of each letter is inversely as the number
of letters, irrespective of distance. The weight enters
very little into the question. Take, for instance, a
route of ten miles, at ten cents a mile, and another of
one hundred miles at the same rate. If on the route
of ten miles there is an average of only one letter, as is
the case on some routes, this one letter would cost one
dollar, while ten thousand letters on the route of one
hundred miles would cost only one mill a letter. The
Post-Office pays a fixed compensation for the daily
transportation of its mails between certain places, and
this compensation is not varied by any addition to the
number of letters. Therefore on all productive or paying
lines, as between Washington and New York, and
then between New York and Buffalo, additional letters
may be received for distant places, without adding to
the cost, until the letters reach St. Louis or New Orleans,
or any other place accessible by a self-supporting
line, and the actual cost of a letter for the longest distance
will be no more than for the shortest. It will be
the same alike to New Orleans and to New York. Thus
on the assumption of a continuous self-supporting line
the question of distance does not enter into the cost,
and thus again we see the injustice of compelling the
correspondence on such a line to the contributions it is
now obliged to make.</p>


<h3>EXISTING RATE NOT OPPRESSIVE A FALLACY.</h3>

<p>Here I encounter an old-fashioned objection common
in England as well as in the United States, and which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
has shown itself at every proposed change in the postal
service. It is said that the existing rate is not oppressive,
and that there is no need of its reduction. Obviously
it is not oppressive to Senators and Representatives,
who send and receive unnumbered letters free;
nor is it oppressive to their correspondents; nor again
is it oppressive to the rich and thriving, for they contribute
out of their abundance; but plainly and indubitably
it is oppressive to the poor, and it is absurd to
say that it is not. Plainly and indubitably it is oppressive
to the widowed mother, whose best comfort is correspondence
with her absent child; it is oppressive to the
child corresponding with mother, sister, or brother; it is
oppressive to all whose scanty means supply only the
necessaries of life. All these are restrained in the gratification
of those affections which contribute so much to
human solace and strength.</p>

<p>Do not say that practically there is little difference
between three cents and one cent,&mdash;that the difference
is hardly appreciable. A great mistake. Is it not appreciable
in the cost of tea, coffee, and sugar? The reduction
of one cent a pound in the tariff on sugar, of
two cents on coffee, or of a few cents on tea, is not treated
as trivial.</p>

<p>There is the poor pensioner with eight dollars a month.
She, too, has family and friends; but the postal tax interferes
to arrest the congenial intercourse. Every letter
adds to the burden she is obliged to bear. Her fingers
forget the pen, and she finds herself alone. Nor is
this hardship peculiar to the poor pensioner. An eminent
citizen and valued friend, who has given much attention
to this subject, states the case thus:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> “When
one of my children is absent, I write a line every day.
Suppose I were a poor widow, earning barely enough to
make the two ends meet, and had children in the West,
to each of whom I should want to write at least once a
week, making in all several dollars a year; then the cost
would be oppressive.” This simple illustration brings
home the operation of the postal tax now imposed by
law, and shows how it troubles those who most need the
care and tenderness of the world. The tax on letters is
like the tax on salt. If it must exist, it must be small,
very small.</p>

<p>There are some who think that no existing institution
is oppressive. According to them, Slavery was not oppressive.
In the same mood, the law of 1845, with its
two rates of five cents and ten cents, and then again the
law of 1855, by which the rate of five cents was reduced
to three cents, were pronounced unnecessary. The multifarious
rates anterior to 1845 were not oppressive, and
in 1855 there was no call for the reduction of the rate
from five cents to three cents. Such was the argument
then, precisely as now. So in the days of Slavery it
was argued that the slaves did not desire freedom, and
that their condition was not oppressive. The great reform
of Rowland Hill encountered the same objection.
Even Lord Ashburton, while favoring a change, was
content with twopence or threepence, and, in his testimony,
settled down upon threepence as satisfactory.
He shrank from the penny rate.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> This question was
treated with excellent sense by Mr. Jones Loyd, whom
I have already quoted, whose testimony bears strongly
on this very objection. After saying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span> “that the present
rate of postage does in point of fact produce a prohibition
of the use of the Post-Office to all classes that
may be considered as below the higher classes,”<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> the
attention of the witness was called by the Committee
to the allegation “that the laboring classes do not
feel the oppressive rate of postage.” He replied in
words of wisdom worthy of memory now, and completely
applicable to the very question now before the
Senate:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The habits of a people are in a great degree the result of
the laws under which they live; the high charges of our
Post-Office have induced, amongst all but the richer classes,
a habit of abstaining from epistolary communication, and it
might take some time to correct that habit. But it appears
to me very desirable that the impediment should be removed;
and I have no doubt, that, in the course of a short time, as
the poorer classes have the common affections of the human
breast, they would form a taste for the pleasures to be derived
from intercourse with absent friends and relations. It
would be very desirable, for the moral interests of the community,
that every facility should be afforded for that purpose.”<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On the “oppression of a tax,” where persons do not
use the article taxed, the intelligent witness testified
as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They may not know the loss they sustain; but that does
not alter the fact that they do sustain a very great loss; and
it would be highly criminal and cruel voluntarily to inflict
such a loss upon a person merely upon the ground that he
does not know it. A child that is born blind does not know
the advantages of sight; but still it would be a very extraordinary
thing to inflict blindness upon a child, merely upon
the ground, that, if you do it, in time he will not know the
loss he has sustained.”<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

</div>

<p>All this is plain and unanswerable. The oppressiveness
of a tax is not to be measured by the insensibility
of the people on whose shoulders it is laid. It is a curiosity
of despotism that the people are too often unconscious
of their slavery, as they are unconscious also of
bad laws. A wise and just Government measures its
duties not by what the people bear without a murmur,
but by what is most for their welfare; and it is to this
criterion that I bring the question of cheap postage.
Say not that the people are indifferent and do not ask
for this reduction. Is it not for their good? Is not the
advantage so eminent and unequivocal that the Government
can no longer hesitate, especially at this transitional
moment, when our country is passing from the
Old to the New, and the people more than ever are assured
in their rights?</p>


<h3>JUSTICE AND PRACTICABILITY OF ONE CENT POSTAGE.</h3>

<p>After this exhibition of existing burdens, so prejudicial
to the correspondence of the country, I return again
to the main postulate of this argument, that a uniform
rate of one cent for a letter of half an ounce is entirely
reasonable, and in a short time, with proper relief in
other directions, would render the Post-Office self-supporting.
Here I introduce the testimony of a gentleman
practically conversant with the operations of our
Post-Office, who writes to me as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Taking the weight of the letter mail-matter and the printed
mail-matter, and charging the expense of transportation
upon each proportioned to the weight, and one cent is all
that would be relatively chargeable upon each half-ounce of
letter mail. I speak from close daily observation in a large
office, in a region that is a large revenue-paying one to the
Department on all mail-matter.”</p>

</div>

<p>This testimony of an expert is only in harmony with
my own conclusion.</p>

<p>This injustice becomes more apparent, when we consider
the disproportion between the cost of other transportation
and letter postage. Take, for instance, the
fare of a passenger on a railway in comparison with
that of a letter. The average weight of passengers with
their baggage is supposed to be 230 pounds, which is
the weight of 7,360 half-ounce letters, paying, at the
present rate of three cents, $220.80, irrespective of distance.
The following table, prepared some time ago,
shows the cost of other transportation:&mdash;</p>

</table>

<p>In other transportation there is a slight increase in
proportion to the distance; but it is difficult to see
on what principle a mail-bag between Washington and
New York should pay more than a passenger; and the
same difficulty occurs when we consider ocean postage,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
where the disproportion between postage and other
transportation is, perhaps, more conspicuous. Elihu
Burritt, who has enforced the importance of cheap rates
on the ocean with admirable comprehension of their importance,
has reminded us that the freight of a barrel of
flour, weighing two hundred pounds, is about fifty cents,
while the charge for the same weight in half-ounce letters,
being sixty-four hundred in number, at the rate of
twenty-four cents a letter, would be no less than $1,536,
and at the rate of one cent would be sixty-four dollars.
These instances show that letters have been always
overcharged, or charged out of proportion to their
weight.</p>

<p>To my mind it is unjust that the letter everywhere
should contribute so largely to the transportation and
delivery of other mail matter, while in some parts of
the country it contributes besides to postal facilities
elsewhere. I think I do not err, when I aver, that,
even with the latter burden, the Post-Office, if it carried
nothing but letters, <em>and every letter paid one cent</em>,
would be self-supporting. I put the case in this way
so as to exhibit the essential equity of the proposed reduction,
and, I would add, its entire practicability. Although
the Post-Office cannot be relieved of the other
mail-matter, yet the letters can be relieved of the burdensome
contribution to which they are now subjected.
One cent postage would give new operation to the law
according to which reduction of price tends to produce
consumption, and there would be a new impulsion to
correspondence, by which in a short time it would be
doubled, tripled, quadrupled, quintupled, and sextupled,&mdash;nay,
in our growing country it would be multiplied
beyond calculation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>As to this increase, I have already shown something
of its progress in Great Britain, beginning with one
hundred and twenty-two per cent. the first year of penny
postage.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Why may not the same take place with
us? According to the official table now on our desks,
the smaller population of the United Kingdom sends
more letters than ours. It would be difficult to credit
this result, if the figures did not tell the tale beyond
correction. Here is the table:<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>Testimony could not be stronger. The smaller population
sends a larger sum-total of letters, making of
course a larger number for each person, and yielding a
larger gross revenue. It is humiliating to think that
the people of this Monarchy send at the rate of twenty-six
letters for each person, while the citizens of our Republic
send only at the rate of twelve for each person.
The inverse disproportion of letters becomes the more
remarkable, when it is understood that the proportion
of people who can read and write is greater among us
than in the United Kingdom, so that, all other things
being equal, the number of letters by each person should
be greater among us; but we are obliged to confront the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
unquestionable fact that the number is less. How is
this? Why is this? I know no way of accounting for
it except in the discouraging cost of correspondence.
Here I find unquestionable reason to conclude that we
have not a proper rate of postage. Clearly something is
wanting. It is not education; for the people among us
excel the British people in this respect. It is not business,
or family, or friendship; for are not all these active
with us? I submit that we want nothing but cheap
postage, so that the people, finding their means in harmony
with the rates, shall be tempted to write letters.
So it was in England; and so it may be among us.</p>

<p>Against the entire reasonableness of the proposed
rate, it will not do to say that in the wages of English
labor a penny is the equivalent of three cents among
us. Even if it be so, there is a twofold answer to the
allegation: first, that convenience and reason concur in
favor of the lowest unit of coin, which with us is the
cent, as in England it is the penny; and, secondly, that
with us the general scale of salary and expenditure is
less than in England, beginning with the President as
compared with the Queen, and embracing the functionaries
of Government in the two countries. The penny,
which is a larger unit than the cent, typifies the larger
scale of price; so that our postage will be brought to
practical equality with that of England only by the
adoption of the corresponding unit of our country. If
this seems refined or technical, let me add that I adduce
it only in answer to an objection, which forgets not only
the beauty of that simplicity found in the lowest unit of
coin, but also that fundamental difference between England
and the United States found in their respective institutions.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>


<h3>POSSIBLE LOSS OF REVENUE.</h3>

<p>Here I am reminded of the possible loss of revenue,
and this is set up as an insuperable barrier; but I confess,
that, when I regard the infinite good from this reform,
I am little concerned by any such prospect. Better
any possible loss of revenue than the postponement
of such a good. Nobody can say positively what the
loss will be. It is only an estimate, or, if you please,
a guess. Some may make it high, others low. According
to the last Reports of the Postmaster-General,
the actual deficiency, with the rate of three cents, was
$5,353,620, and the estimated deficiency for 1870 is
$7,440,413; but in both cases the expenditures are
swollen by illegitimate and extrinsic charges on the
Post-Office properly belonging to the Treasury. For
1871, with the rate at three cents, the estimated expenditures,
swollen by the illegitimate and extrinsic
charges, are $25,581,093, with receipts, $20,178,961,
leaving a deficiency of $5,402,132.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a></p>

<p>Making the estimate for 1871 with the rate of one
cent, and assuming an increase in correspondence at
only one hundred per cent., there would be a deficiency
of $12,128,452, from which should be deducted the illegitimate
and extrinsic charges properly belonging to the
Treasury. Considering these for one moment, you will
see how small the deficiency will be; and here I follow
the last Report of the Postmaster-General, who does not
hesitate to estimate the proportion of free matter in the
mails at twenty-five per cent. of the whole, so that, according<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
to him, “it will appear that the Government is
bound in honor and justice to appropriate $5,000,000,
instead of $700,000 [the present appropriation], for this
service.”<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> But with the abolition of the franking system
all this postal matter will pay the ordinary rate,
and thus contribute to the postal service. Deduct also
another sum for the expenditures of outlying routes,
justly chargeable upon the Treasury, like the existing
franking system.</p>

<p>Such is the whole case as to any possible loss of revenue,
which I state with entire frankness; but I cannot
doubt that a short period would witness a change, while
the people entered into the enjoyment of their great
possession. Letters would daily multiply, and the revenue
would bear witness to the increase.</p>


<h3>THE POST-OFFICE NOT A TAXING MACHINE, BUT A
BENEFICENT AGENCY.</h3>

<p>Only in obedience to traditional usage have I dwelt
thus long on the financial aspect of this question, which
to my mind is the least important of all. Not to make
money, but to promote the welfare of the people, and to
increase the happiness of all,&mdash;such is the precious object
I would propose; and here I ask no such question
as, “Will it pay?” It may not pay in revenue at once,
but it will pay in what is above price. Unhappily, the
Post-Office, whether at home or abroad, has been from
the beginning little more than <em>a taxing machine</em>, a contrivance
to raise money, or a “milch cow” with fruitful
dugs. In England it was at times farmed out to a
speculator, and then again it was charged with the support<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
of a royal mistress or favorite. For its profits only
was it regarded, and not for its agency in the concerns
of life. In this respect it was not unlike the Government,
which was simply a usurpation for the benefit of
the few. All this is now changed, at least among us,
and Government is the creation of the people for their
good. The Post-Office should share this transformation.
Instead of a mere taxing machine, or contrivance
to raise money, or “milch cow” with fruitful dugs, it
should be an omnipresent beneficent minister, reaching
its multitudinous hands with help and comfort into all
the homes of our wide-spread land. Such it is already
in England, to the infinite joy of all. But the omnipresent
beneficent minister belongs to a republic more
than to a monarchy. Cheap postage is a republican institution.
If England has anticipated us, we may at
least profit by her example.</p>

<p>It is because Senators see the Post-Office only in its
least elevated, not to say its most vulgar character, that
there is any hesitation. Contemplate for one moment,
if you please, its great and beautiful office. It is the
universal messenger of a people, bearing tidings of all
kinds, whether of business, hope, affection, charity, joy,
or sorrow, and articulating them throughout the land.
There is nothing that man can do, desire, or feel, which
is not contained in the various and abounding errand.
The letters of a single day are the epitome of life, and
this service is unceasing. Every day this messenger
flies over the land, from city to city, from town to town,
from village to village, from house to house, leaving
everywhere the welcome token. Such a messenger is
more than a winged Mercury, with sandalled feet and
purse in hand, whose special care was commerce; it is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
an angel in reality, as in name. In the ancient Greek,
from which the word is derived, an angel was a messenger;
and is not the office of our messenger angelic?
But by what rule or reason can you tax such a messenger
in his great and beautiful office?</p>

<p>A letter is simply conversation in writing, and therefore,
by strictness of logic, the tax you impose is a tax
on conversation. Reflect a moment on the part performed
by conversation in the education of men and in
the economies of life; and here I give you testimony.
Once at Mr. Webster’s table I heard the question
discussed, “From what do men derive most of what
they know?” The scholars about him answered,&mdash;one
naming “Our Mothers,” another “Schools,” another
“Books,” another “Newspapers,” when the host, who
had listened to each, remarked, very gravely, “You forget
Conversation, from which, in my judgment, we derive
the larger part of what we know.” Who shall say
that Mr. Webster was not right? It is clear that conversation
is a wonderful educator and a constant servant.
But conversation in writing, no matter on what
subject, whether of business or of the heart, is now subject
to an unrelenting tax, so that persons conversing
by letter must not only pay the cost of the intermediary
in their own case, but must contribute to the expense of
other conversations elsewhere.</p>


<h3>THAT THE POST-OFFICE MUST SUPPORT ITSELF
A FALLACY.</h3>

<p>Custom makes us insensible to folly, and even to injustice.
Thus the tax on letters has gained an undeserved
immunity, which is augmented by a prevailing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
notion, sometimes supposed to find authority even in
the Constitution, that the Post-Office must support itself.
Whether regarded as rule or maxim or provision
of the Constitution, it is without foundation, and sooner
or later will be classed with those “vulgar errors” which
are as disturbing in government as in science. There
is nothing in the Constitution or in reason to distinguish
the Post-Office in this respect from the Army, the
Navy, or the Judiciary. The Constitution confers upon
Congress the power “to establish post-offices and post-roads,”
precisely as it confers upon Congress the power
“to raise and support armies,” the power “to provide
and maintain a navy,” and the power “to constitute tribunals
inferior to the Supreme Court”; and in each of
these cases it is empowered “to make all laws which
shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers.” Nobody suggests that
now in peace our armies shall amplify their commissariat
by enforced contributions, that our navy shall redouble
its economies by supplementary piracy, or that
our tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court shall eke
out a salary by requisitions on the suitors, to the end
that each of these departments may be in some measure
“self-supporting.” Why, then, should the Post-Office
be subjected to a different rule? Not, surely, because
it is less beneficent; not because it is the youngest
child of Government, a very Benjamin, coming into
being long after the others. But such is the case.
The rule for the others is discarded when we come
to the Post-Office, and here for the first time we hear
that a Department of Government must be “self-supporting.”</p>

<p>As there is no ground in the Constitution for this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
pretension, so is there none in reason. Of all existing
departments, the Post-Office is most entitled to consideration,
for it is most universal in its beneficence. That
public welfare which is the declared object of all the
departments appears here in its most attractive form.
There is nothing which is not helped by the Post-Office.
Is business in question? The Post-Office is at hand
with invaluable aid, quickening and multiplying all its
activities. Is it charity? The Post-Office is the good
Samaritan, omnipresent on all the highways of the land.
Is it the precious intercourse of family or friends? The
Post-Office is carrier, interpreter, and handmaid. Is it
education? The Post-Office is schoolmaster, with school
for all and with scholars counted by the million. Is it
the service of Government? The Post-Office lends itself
so completely to this essential work, that the national
will is conveyed without noise or effort to the
most remote corners, and the Republic becomes one and
indivisible. Without the Post-Office where would be
that national unity, with irresistible guaranty of Equal
Rights to All, which is now the glory of the Republic?
Impossible! absolutely impossible! Therefore, in the
name of all these, do I insist that now, in these days of
equality, the Post-Office shall be admitted to equality
with all other departments of Government, so that it
may discharge its own peculiar and many-sided duties,
without being compelled to find in itself the means of
support. It has enough to do without taking thought
of the morrow. On every side and in every direction
it is the beneficent helper. To the Army it is a staff;
to the Navy it is a tender; to the Treasury it is a support;
to the Judiciary it is a police; to President and
Congress it is an adjunct; and to all else, public or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
private, whatever the interest, aspiration, or sentiment,
it is an incomparable ally. Better than two blades of
grass are two letters where was only one before; and
when the precious product is measured by millions, you
see the vastness of the beneficence.</p>


<h3>OUR POST-OFFICE MUST BE THE BEST IN THE WORLD:
PRESENT DUTY.</h3>

<p>Such is the Post-Office; and nothing is clearer than
that here in the United States it should be of the highest
type. Ours should be the best in the world,&mdash;not
second to any. So long as Slave-Masters bore sway,
this could not be; for they set their faces against this
minister of Civilization. One of the first legislative acts
of the Rebel Government at Montgomery was to raise
the rates.<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> But this hostile obstruction is now overcome,
and we are at last free to act for the good of all.
It is for the welfare of the people that our Republic is
founded, and therefore it should omit nothing by which
their condition is improved and elevated. Other Governments
may seek to augment the revenue. Our aim
should be to augment the sum of human happiness,
making it the crown of our whole people; and just
in proportion as we fail in this duty is the Republic a
failure. But the best Post-Office is where letters at
the smallest charge are faithfully carried to every door,
thus combining cheapness and efficiency. That ours
may fulfil this condition there must be a change.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>
<p>Our duty is simple. It is to relieve the Post-Office
of present burdens, including especially the franking
system and the expense of unproductive routes, while
at the same time we establish a uniform rate of one
cent. To these cardinal objects may be added others
named in the bill introduced by me, especially the
requirement of payment always by stamps, so as to
simplify the accounts and to make peculation impossible;
but the fundamental change is in the rate of
postage.</p>

<p>Could my desires prevail, the Post-Office should be
like the Common School, open to all, with this only
condition, that the rate should be sufficient to guard
against abuse. But this is accomplished by that now
proposed.</p>

<p>Let the uniform rate be one cent and you will witness
a transformation. The power to frank, which is
now confined to a few, will practically belong to all,
and letters will be multiplied in proportion,&mdash;opening
to the people an inexhaustible source of all good influences,
whether of education, wealth, virtue, or happiness,
while the Republic rises in the scale of civilization.
Such a rate will be better than a mine of gold in
every State,&mdash;better than a band of iron for the Union,&mdash;better
than a fortress scowling on uncounted hilltops;
for it will be an angelic power.</p>

<p>And could this rate be extended to international postage,
its least service would be to our commercial relations.
Beyond this would be an inconceivable influence
on that immigration to our country which is a constant
fountain of life, while it carried into the homes of the
Old World the most seductive invitations to take part
with us in our great destinies. Republican ideas would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
be diffused, and the Rights of Man gain new authority.
Every letter from glowing firesides among us, when read
at colder firesides abroad, would be a perpetual proclamation
of the Republic.</p>

<p>More than ever this change is needed now. It is
essential in the work of Reconstruction, which can be
maintained only through the national unity. The very
extent of our country, which is superficially urged as
the apology for a high rate, is to my mind an all-sufficient
reason for the proposed reform. Because our
country is broad and spacious, therefore must distant
parts be brought into communication and woven together
by daily recurring ties. Because our people are various
in origin and language, therefore must they be enabled
to commingle and become homogeneous. And,
lastly, because fellow-citizens have suffered and been
separated by terrible war, therefore must the Post-Office
become a good angel to quicken industry, to remove ignorance,
to soothe prejudice, and to promote harmony.
Blessed are the peace-makers; and in this company the
Post-Office, properly reformed, will take an illustrious
place.</p>

<h2><a name="CHINESE_INDEMNITY_FUND" id="CHINESE_INDEMNITY_FUND"></a>CHINESE INDEMNITY FUND.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Report in the Senate, of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, June 24, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hanging">The Committee on Foreign Relations, to whom was referred
the message of the President of March 10, 1870, covering
a report of the Secretary of State and correspondence concerning
the Chinese Indemnity Fund, also certain petitions
on the same subject, have had the same under consideration,
and beg leave to report.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">The origin and history of the Chinese Indemnity
Fund are found in authentic documents, so that
little need be done except to state the case from these
authorities.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The British and French expeditions of 1858, which,
after capturing Canton, turned their combined forces
toward Peking, and ascended the Pei-ho as far as Tien-tsin,
opened the way to the presentation of claims of
our citizens, which were promptly recognized by the
Chinese Government. Though taking no part in the
war, our people profited by the result. The convention
that ensued was born of the war.</p>


<h3>THE CONVENTION AND PAYMENT OF CLAIMS.</h3>

<p>Claims were brought forward amounting to more than
one and a quarter million of dollars; but Mr. Reed, our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
Minister in China, concluded, after examination, that
600,000 taels, or about $840,000, was a proper estimate
for all rightfully due. Accordingly he entered into an
arrangement with the Chinese plenipotentiaries for their
prospective liquidation. At first there was nothing but
an agreement in correspondence, being a sort of executory
contract, which was unsatisfactory in form, incomplete
in stipulations, and embarrassed by the condition
that in the adjudication of the claims a Chinese officer
should take part. All this involved delay, at least, if
not more. At last this agreement was embodied in the
terms of a convention between the two governments,
dispensing with Chinese coöperation, and the amount of
damages was reduced to 500,000 taels, to be paid from
the maritime revenues of Shanghai, Foo-chow, and Canton,
in complete discharge of all demands.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>The original agreement was at Tien-tsin, where the
Chinese met the British, French, and Russian negotiators;
but the convention was finally executed at Shanghai,
November 8, 1858. The statement already made
appears in the terms of the convention. After setting
forth that certain maritime revenues were pledged for
the payment of American claims, “to an amount not exceeding
600,000 taels,” the convention proceeds to declare,
“And the plenipotentiary of the United States, actuated
by a friendly feeling towards China, is willing, on
behalf of the United States, to reduce the amount needed
for such claims to an aggregate of 500,000 taels”;
and then it is agreed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span> “that this amount shall be in full
liquidation of all claims of American citizens at the various
ports to this date.”<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Reed, in communicating this treaty to the Department
of State, says, under date of November 10,
1858:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nor has there been any great difficulty in effecting it, the
Chinese plenipotentiaries showing no disposition to evade the
agreement they had entered into at Tien-tsin, and being quite
willing to arrange the details on reasonable grounds.”<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The Minister then proceeds to say, that his first duty&mdash;“not
the less binding because to the Chinese”&mdash;was
to revise the claims themselves, and ascertain whether,
after giving credit for such as had in the mean time
been settled and paid, and applying some clear principle
of law, the aggregate could not be reduced; and he
adds, that “the amount assumed at Tien-tsin was an
arbitrary one.” In order to arrive at a more precise result,
he called upon the claimants for a revised statement
of their demands. In many instances the requisition
was complied with; in others it was made the
occasion for “all sorts of speculative and contingent
claims,&mdash;such, for example, as a vice-consul asking to
be remunerated for fees that he might have made, and
the captain of a steamer claiming the profits of a year
to come.” Notwithstanding these instances the claims
were revised in a proper spirit, and were sensibly reduced
by the claimants themselves. Still there were
many of a contingent character. On a careful review
of all the evidence before him, the Minister was satisfied
that he could materially reduce the amount to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
demanded, which was accordingly done. In the draught
of the convention first submitted to the Commissioners
at Shanghai, the amount stated was 525,000 taels, with
a provision, that, in case of excess beyond the claims
and interest, it should be refunded to the Chinese Government;
on which the Minister remarks: “They preferred,
however, the small sum without such provision,
evidently thinking it was their best policy to get rid of
the matter forever.”<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> The language of the Commissioners
was:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We acknowledge the consideration and kindness of your
Excellency in this matter, in that you have, of your own accord,
reduced the first amount of claims, and now place the
total at 525,000 taels. We have taken the matter into full
consultation, and propose, that, if a further reduction of
25,000 taels be made, fixing the total amount at 500,000
taels, then custom-house certificates can be issued at Canton,
Shanghai, and Foo-chow, dating from the first day of our
next year, (February 3, 1859,) which can be successively
applied to the gradual payment of the entire sum.”<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a></p>

</div>

<p>These terms were embodied in the final convention
between the parties.</p>

<p>After this exposition, the Minister declares that the
convention, if ratified by our Government, and carried
into execution by the Chinese, as he did not doubt it
would be, would liquidate every claim on China by citizens
of the United States, principal and Chinese interest
at twelve per cent. per annum, on most of the claims
for three years, and for a longer period on others, among
which was one as ancient as 1847, which had occupied
the attention and excited the sympathies of many of his
predecessors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span></p>

<p>The Minister appends a tabular statement of claims,
with a list of what he calls “Claims Suspended,” among
which is one known as “The Caldera,” to which reference
will be made hereafter. He then says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A sufficient sum can be reserved to cover these claims,
<em>all of which are more or less doubtful</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And adds:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“If they be recognized, and the principle of paying interest
be adopted throughout, the fund will be exhausted. If
they be disallowed, though interest be paid to all the other
claimants, there will be a surplus at the disposition of the
Government.”<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus early was there anticipation of a surplus.</p>

<p>At the same time the Minister suggested that Congress
should provide for the adjudication of the claims
and a dividend among claimants. This was done by
the Act of March 3, 1859, entitled “An Act to carry
into effect the Convention between the United States
and China, concluded on the 8th of November, 1858,
at Shanghai,”<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> authorizing the appointment of commissioners
“to receive and examine all claims which may
be presented to them under the said convention, according
to the provisions of the same, the principles of justice
and International Law,”&mdash;and further providing
“that the said commissioners shall report to the chief
diplomatic officer in China the several awards made by
them, to be approved by him,” which are to be paid out
of the revenues set apart for this purpose, in ratable
proportion, “according to the direction of the said diplomatic
officer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>The examination of the claims was completed in January,
1860, and the payments directed by the Commissioners
were duly made. Then occurred a condition of
things almost without precedent in the relations of nations.
After all the payments directed by the Commissioners,
a large surplus was found in the custody of the
legation at Peking, which was subsequently transferred
to the United States. This surplus, with accumulations
of interest and gain by exchange, less an amount paid
under authority of an Act of Congress approved February
22, 1869,<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> has been invested in Ten-Forty bonds,
which are now held by the State Department, amounting
at par to $386,000. Another amount of $206.87 in
cash is also in the possession of the Department; and
about $2,000 remain in the custody of the Minister to
China, who has been directed to make remittance of the
same.<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a></p>

<p>The Secretary of State, in his Report on this subject,
as late as March 10, 1870, says that he “is not aware of
any claims against this fund which have not been considered
by the Commissioners and determined by them.”<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>


<h3>PROPOSITIONS WITH REGARD TO SURPLUS.</h3>

<p>This surplus has been the subject of discussion for
more than a decade of years. During all this time it
has been before Congress without any definitive action.
As long ago as December, 1860, it was thus noticed by
President Buchanan in his Annual Message:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“After the awards shall have been satisfied, there will remain
a surplus of more than $200,000 at the disposition of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Congress. <em>As this will in equity belong to the Chinese Government</em>,
would not justice require its appropriation to some benevolent
object in which the Chinese may be specially interested?”<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing was done by Congress, and President Lincoln,
in his Annual Message of December, 1861, thus
followed in the footsteps of his predecessor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I repeat the recommendation of my predecessor, in his
Annual Message to Congress in December last, in regard to
the disposition of the surplus which will probably remain
after satisfying the claims of American citizens against China,
pursuant to the awards of the Commissioners under the Act
of the 3d of March, 1859. If, however, it should not be
deemed advisable to carry that recommendation into effect, I
would suggest that authority be given for investing the principal,
over the proceeds of the surplus referred to, in good securities,
with a view to the satisfaction of such other just
claims of our citizens against China as are not unlikely to
arise hereafter in the course of our extensive trade with that
empire.”<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The subject was at this time considered by the Committee
on Foreign Relations, aided by the Secretary of
State, who laid before the Committee all the original
papers relating to the proceedings of the Commissioners.
In a communication to the Committee,<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Mr. Seward
stated the case as he understood it, recognizing “the
refunding of the whole amount to the Chinese” as one
of the methods which “suggest themselves.” This was
in the summer of 1862, at the most critical period of
the war for the suppression of the Rebellion, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
Committee did not feel disposed at that time to make
any recommendation with regard to the fund.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the disposition of this fund was discussed
elsewhere. Our distinguished representative in China,
Mr. Burlingame, entered upon it with characteristic ardor.
Regarding the fund as essentially Chinese in character,
if not belonging in equity to China, he urged that
it should be devoted to the foundation of an institution
of learning at Peking, which he proposed to call The
American College, or <i>Ta-Mei Kwoh Hioh-kung</i>: first, to
teach Americans the language and literature of China,
so as to fit them to be interpreters and consuls; and,
secondly, to educate Chinese in English studies and in
their own literature, with a view to employment by
their own rulers or by the United States. The usefulness
and practicability of such a college were developed
in two elaborate dispatches,&mdash;one bearing date Shanghai,
May 19, 1862,<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> and the other, Peking, November
18, 1863,<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> in the course of which Mr. Burlingame said
that he was “disposed to urge the adoption of this proposal
more with a reference to the benefit such a college
would be to the Chinese than to ourselves.”<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> Not content
with thus declaring his desire to make this fund of
benefit to them, he says,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span> “In equity the balance appears
to belong to the Chinese, but they have no voice in its
disposal.”<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> His eloquent appeal has thus far been without
effect. Nothing has been done to carry out his recommendation,
and the question still remains, What to
do with the fund?</p>

<p>It is sometimes proposed that this fund should be reserved
for the satisfaction of possible claims hereafter.
But this would be contrary to the terms of the convention,
which expressly provides for the “claims of American
citizens at the various ports <em>to this date</em>,”&mdash;thus
positively limiting the disposition of the fund. Mr.
Burlingame, without referring to the terms of the convention,
objected to any such reservation as calculated
to produce embarrassment in our relations with China.
According to him, “<em>it would be preferable to return the
whole to them</em>, or distribute the money, as it accrues, to
the disappointed claimants, and those Chinese in the
employ of our citizens who suffered severe losses in
consequence of their connection with them, than to lay
it aside for future contingencies to settle with a government
like the Chinese.”<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> His authority on this proposition
may be considered decisive.</p>

<p>But there is another consideration which leads to the
same conclusion. Any retention of the fund to meet
possible future claims is a plain recognition of the interest,
if not the proprietorship of China; and since there
is no authority under the convention for its application
to possible future claims, it will be at least questionable
whether the Chinese Government should not have a
voice in the adjudication of such claims. At all events,
we shall assume a peculiar responsibility, if we undertake
to apply this fund to claims not contemplated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
the convention. Nor is there any reason of expediency
which can justify such an assumption on our part.
China has evinced no disposition to be otherwise than
just to American citizens. Although twelve years have
elapsed since the date of the convention, there are no
outstanding claims against China which have received
the sympathy of our Government. Should any such
claims arise, it were far better that they should be presented
directly, and be satisfied by an award in their
favor. Meanwhile the old account should be closed.</p>

<p>A remark of Mr. Burlingame, already quoted, requires
one word of comment. He mentions, as a possible
course, the distribution of the fund among “disappointed
claimants, and those Chinese in the employ
of our citizens who suffered severe losses in consequence
of their connection with them.” Of the Chinese mentioned
the Committee know nothing. No claims in
their behalf have been presented. But since the award
of the Commissioners three different cases have occurred,
coming under the head of “Disappointed Claimants.”
The disposition of these is mentioned at the end of
this Report.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> It does not seem advisable that the
fund should be kept to meet such applications. The
awards of the Commissioners have been approved by
our Minister in China, and the proceedings closed. If
they were opened in the case of the Neva, it was because
the claimants there had not been heard in China.
It is not supposed that any other occasion can arise to
open these proceedings. The fund in question cannot
be regarded as a charity or largess for the gratification
of “disappointed claimants,” nor would it be proper for
the United States to play such a generous part at the
expense of China.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>
<p>Our country has no house for its legation at Peking
or for its consulates in other places, nor does it possess
any buildings in China which it might use as courthouse
or jail; and latterly there has been a strong disposition
to apply this fund in this direction. Mr. Seward
seems to have inclined this way, as appears from
his Report to Congress,<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> and Mr. Fish also, as appears
from his Report to Congress.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> But this disposition proceeds
on the admission that the fund differs materially
from other moneys of the United States,&mdash;that, if it
does not belong to China, it bears the Chinese earmark
so strongly that it cannot be treated as belonging to our
national assets. In point of fact, all attempts to cover
it into the Treasury have proved unsuccessful.</p>

<p>Petitions from opposite quarters with regard to the
disposition of the fund attest a prevailing interest.</p>

<p>At a meeting of citizens in New York, March 11,
1870, a distinguished committee was appointed, with
Isaac Ferris, Chancellor of the University, as chairman,
with whom as associates were William E. Dodge, President
of the Chamber of Commerce, Frederick S. Winston,
E. D. Morgan, E. C. Benedict, A. A. Low, John C.
Green, James H. Taft, Stewart Brown, and William P.
Jones, many of them having large interests in China,
who adopted resolutions on this subject to be forwarded
to Congress. The first resolution declares,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That this Committee is of opinion that the surplus of
the Indemnity Fund received from the Chinese under the
Convention of 1858, referred to in the Annual Message of
President Buchanan to the Second Session of the Thirty-Sixth
Congress, and of President Lincoln to the Second Session
of the Thirty-Seventh Congress, with the accumulation
thereon, <em>certainly does belong in equity to the Chinese Government</em>,
as the Presidents therein declare, and <em>should be returned
to it</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Committee then proceed to say, that, if such surplus
shall be declined by China, it should be expended,
according to the recommendation of Mr. Burlingame, in
founding a literary institution for the equal benefit of
Chinese and Americans.</p>

<p>Chicago responded to New York. At a meeting of
citizens March 31st, another committee was organized,
with R. B. Mason, the Mayor, as chairman,&mdash;and
among the members were William Bross, Lieutenant-Governor
of Illinois, Thomas Drummond, Judge of the
United States Circuit Court, James E. McLean, Collector
of Customs, N. S. Davis, Professor of Surgery in
the Medical College, Samuel M. Wiseman, President
of the First National Bank, J. C. Burroughs, President
of the University of Chicago, and E. D. Haven, President
of the Northwestern University, with others,&mdash;and
adopted resolutions, where, after approving those
of New York, they declare,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That it seems to us eminently fitting and fortunate that
this money, <em>which distinguished representatives of the United
States have asserted belongs in equity to the Chinese Government</em>,
though that government is disposed to waive its right
to it, should be employed in some way to the common advantage
and honor of both nations.”</p>

</div>

<p>The committee then proceed to resolve further,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That in view of the impression conveyed by Secretary
Seward’s Report to the Third Session of the Fortieth Congress,
that the Chinese authorities are unwilling to receive
this money, this Committee respectfully memorializes Congress
to cover it into the United States Treasury as <em>a special
fund, to be returned to the Chinese Treasury</em>, or hereafter appropriated
to the establishment of the proposed institution of
learning at Peking, <em>as the Chinese Government may elect</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>These two weighty committees concur in recognizing
the equity of China, if not her proprietorship, in this
fund. If it be true that the surplus belongs to China,
or that it is hers in equity, it will be difficult to defend
any proposition to return the amount indirectly, as in a
college or buildings for the accommodation of the United
States on Chinese soil. If returned at all, it must be
directly, and in the form of money. What right have
we to determine how to expend in China or for China
that which is hers? To do so would not be generous,
even if it were just. It would be ostentatious, and
might be offensive. It would assume that we can employ
the money of China, even in China, for her own
benefit, better than she can herself. At all events, it
would recognize an undefined title in China, to which
we deferred.</p>


<h3>THE CHINESE HAVE NOT REFUSED TO RECEIVE IT.</h3>

<p>But it cannot be disguised, that, when the two Secretaries
of State concurred in the idea of appropriating
this fund to the erection of buildings, also when Mr.
Burlingame made his earnest effort for its appropriation
to a college at Peking, and when two successive Presidents
invited Congress to consider what should be done
with it, there was an impression not only that the Chinese
would not allow the surplus to be returned, but
that they had peremptorily declined to entertain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
proposition. Such was the impression when the attention
of the Committee was first called to this fund,
now many years ago. And it cannot be doubted that
this impression has exercised an influence in preventing
frank and explicit action on the question, according
to the obvious requirement of justice.</p>

<p>The Committee have endeavored to ascertain the
ground for the statement that the Chinese had refused
to receive the surplus. It seems, on inquiry, to be a
report or rumor started nobody knows precisely how or
when. Thus we find Mr. Seward saying, in his Report
of February 18, 1868:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It appears, that, when it was ascertained that this surplus
would remain, the return of it to the Chinese Government
was proposed, but that they declined to accept it.”<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And Mr. Fish, in a similar Report, under date of
March 10, 1870, says likewise:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Secretary of State is informed, that, after the awards
were completed, and it was definitely known that there would
be a surplus, Mr. Burlingame informally proposed to return
whatever should be left. The Chinese, however, did not
seem disposed to accept it.”<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

</div>

<p>But these distinguished Secretaries do not adduce any
authority for their assertion; nor does careful search at
the State Department disclose any dispatch or record
sustaining or justifying it. On this point the Committee
are confident. No instruction was ever given to
any Minister authorizing him to tender a return of the
surplus, or even to sound the Chinese Government on
the question of receiving it, if tendered. In fact, no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
power exists in the State Department to authorize such
a tender. Such an act could proceed only from Congress,
which has never acted on the subject.</p>

<p>The Committee, therefore, dismiss the assumption
that there has been any tender to the Chinese, or any
refusal on their part, whether formal or informal, and
they approach the question simply on its merits.</p>


<h3>DUTY TO CHINA.</h3>

<p>Had this question arisen in our relations with a European
power, it would be only according to an important
precedent, if we forbore to open the transaction.
By two separate conventions, one in 1815 and the other
in 1818, France paid to England a large sum, amounting
to one hundred and thirty million francs, on account of
English claimants, and the English Government undertook
to dispose of all their claims, as the United States
undertook to dispose of all the claims of American citizens
in China. In 1852 Lord Lyndhurst brought the subject
before the House of Lords, when he stated that there
was “an unapplied balance of upwards of £200,000”;<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
and in 1861 Mr. Denman did the same in the House of
Commons, when he said, that, “after all claims had been
satisfied, there still remained a sum of £200,000 not in
any way to be considered due under the convention.”<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
Nothing was said of returning this surplus to France.
The Baron de Bode, a renowned litigant, made an ineffectual
attempt to obtain something out of it on account
of losses in France, although his case was argued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
with consummate ability in the English courts,
and awakened the eloquence of Lord Lyndhurst in the
House of Lords. In an appeal for justice, the Baron
declares that out of the amount received by England,
only 67,071,301 francs had been paid to claimants, and
he insists that the Crown should account to the claimants,
<em>or to France</em>, for the unexpended surplus,&mdash;thus
recognizing an eventual proprietorship in France, after
the satisfaction of the claims.<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> What has been done
with this surplus since is not known.</p>

<p>But while the importance of doing equity always is a
paramount duty, the Committee feel that there is something
in the negotiation under which this surplus accrued
which should make us particularly careful lest we
fail to do equity. It will be observed that the sum received
from China was on account of certain claims of
our citizens, and that it was in no sense a national indemnity;
in other words, the consideration was specific,
and not general in character. The preamble of the convention
recites that it was entered into “for the satisfaction
of claims of American citizens,”&mdash;thus expressly
excluding any other consideration. With regard to
these claims the Chinese had little or no information,
while our Minister saw clearly, that, with the disallowance
of those doubtful, which he regarded as probable,
there would be a surplus. His words were: “If they be
recognized, the fund will be exhausted. If they be disallowed,
there will be a surplus at the disposition of the
Government.”<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> The actual surplus was about thirty-three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
and a third per cent. of the amount stipulated, and
about fifty per cent. of the amount awarded to claimants.
The considerableness of this sum is another reason why
we should hesitate to take advantage of a transaction
where we were so situated as to be the best informed
on the matter in issue. If we did not know everything
bearing on it, we knew much more than the Chinese.</p>

<p>In fact, the Chinese acted in the dark; and here we
have the testimony of Mr. Williams, the interpreter of
our Minister in the negotiation, and still an honored
servant of the Government, who has said in a dispatch:
“No list was presented to the Chinese by Mr. Reed”;
and again, “The United States Government was made
the sole judge of the justice of the claims”; and then
again, “In reality, they [the Chinese] paid the demands
made upon them by the English and French Ministers,
as well as the American, <em>under pressure</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> If this were
so,&mdash;and one of our own officers is the witness,&mdash;the
equity of the Chinese becomes more apparent. Obviously,
they were unable to examine the claims, and did
not pretend to examine them. Everything was left to
the United States. And this was done while the ancient
empire was torn by civil war, aggravated by the
menacing attitudes of England and France. It is not
too much to say that it was done “under pressure.”
According to well-known authorities, a deed made under
<em>duress</em> may be set aside; and this rule of jurisprudence
shows a just sensitiveness with regard to that
absolute freedom which is essential to the life of a contract.
Such a rule, if applied in the intercourse of nations,
would invalidate most of those conventions after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
war or menace by which one power has assumed obligations
to another, and, indeed, would strike at war and
menace as modes of pursuing a claim. In the present
case the validity of the convention is not called in
question; but, since we assert no right of conquest,
it is properly suggested that the original pressure upon
China, attested by one of our own functionaries, peculiarly
intimate with the transaction, is an additional
reason why we should decline to take advantage of the
convention beyond the just satisfaction of our citizens.</p>

<p>And this brings the Committee to the conclusion,
that, in equity, this fund does not belong to us. Whatever
may be our technical title, in conscience the money
is not ours.</p>

<p>In returning to China the fund in question and its
accretions, the United States will relieve themselves of
an embarrassing trust, while they render unto the distant
Cæsar what is his own, and set an example by
which republican institutions will be elevated. The
question of its application, which has occupied the attention
of successive Presidents, which has been presented
to successive Congresses, and is still undecided,
will be at rest. Schemes for the bestowal of the fund
in such a way as to harmonize our sense of justice with
our obligations to China, if not with Chinese proprietorship,
will cease. There will be nothing for “disappointed
claimants” to pursue. China will receive her own,&mdash;if
with astonishment, it will be only because nations
have so rarely lived according to the Golden Rule.
Such an act cannot be otherwise than honorable to
the United States. It will be a victory in a new field,
making us first in a new order of conquerors. China,
with infinite resources, will be more than ever open to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
American enterprise. Thus, while doing right, shall we
benefit ourselves. So is justice to others the way to national
advantage. But whatever this advantage, it must
not be forgotten that the first inducement is the essential
equity of the case.</p>

<p>The measure now proposed will be valuable in proportion
as it is spontaneous. Thus far China has made
no demand, or suggestion even. A year hence the venerable
Empire may appear before the youthful Republic
with a formal claim. The very fact that we deliberate
about this fund will spread the tidings of its existence.
Better anticipate a demand than wait and at last yield
an ungracious compliance, urged by a foreign plenipotentiary
in the service of the ancient government whose
money is now in our hands.</p>

<p>The Report was accompanied by the following Joint Resolution,
which was read and passed to a second reading:&mdash;</p>

</div>


<h3>JOINT RESOLUTION, DIRECTING THE RETURN OF CERTAIN
MONEYS TO THE GOVERNMENT OF CHINA.</h3>

<p>Whereas on the 8th day of November, 1858, a convention
was entered into between the United States and China
for the settlement of claims against the latter by citizens of
the United States, and in pursuance thereof an amount of
five hundred thousand taels, making seven hundred thousand
dollars in gold, or thereabouts, was paid by China, out of
which sum, after the satisfaction of all claims exhibited by
citizens of the United States, there remains in the hands of
the United States an unappropriated surplus, amounting,
with interest and exchange, to four hundred thousand dollars
in currency, or thereabouts, which sum is now in custody
of the Department of State: Now, therefore,</p>

<p><i>Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of
the United States of America in Congress assembled</i>, That the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
unappropriated surplus now in the hands of the United
States, under the convention with China, of November 8,
1858, be refunded to the Government of China; and it
shall be the duty of the President of the United States to
see that this is carried into effect.</p>

LETTER OF MR. SEWARD TO MR. SUMNER.</h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Department of State, Washington</span>, June 21, 1862.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I duly received your letter of the 3d instant, accompanied
by a copy of the resolution of the Senate of the 2d
instant, referring to the consideration of the Committee on
Foreign Relations of that part of the President’s Annual
Message to Congress, of December last, which adverts to
the difference between the amount stipulated to be paid
by China in satisfaction of claims of United States citizens
and the gross amount of the awards of the Commissioners appointed
pursuant to the Act of Congress of the 3d of March,
1859.</p>

<p>In compliance with your request for information and suggestion
upon the subject, I have the honor to communicate a
copy of the Convention, a copy of the Act to carry it into
effect, a copy of all the correspondence on record or on file
in the Department touching the matter, and all the original
papers relating to the proceedings of the Commissioners. It
is desirable that great care should be taken of these last, and
that they should be returned to the Department as soon as
the subject shall have been disposed of.</p>

<p>The circumstance of the complaints against the Chinese,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
which it was the purpose of the convention to adjust, having
arisen in a peculiar region and among a singular people, probably
suggested the appointment of Commissioners resident on
the spot, who were familiar with the scene of their duties.
It is understood, therefore, that, upon the recommendation of
Mr. Reed, the Minister who concluded the convention, Mr.
Charles W. Bradley, who was United States Consul at Ning-po,
and Mr. Oliver E. Roberts, who had acted in a similar
capacity elsewhere in China, and both of whom had long resided
in that country, were appointed Commissioners. The
business-like manner in which they discharged their trust is
manifest from the records of the Commission.</p>

<p>With regard to the disposition of the surplus in question,
three methods suggest themselves.</p>

<p>1. The refunding of the whole amount to the Chinese.</p>

<p>2. Appropriating the whole or a part of it in payment of
claims supposed to have been unjustly rejected by the Commissioners,
and of others in which the amounts allowed may
not have been satisfactory to the claimants.</p>

<p>3. Retaining the whole surplus in the Treasury of the
United States, or causing it to be invested toward indemnifying
citizens who may hereafter be injured by the Chinese
authorities.</p>

<p>I will abstain from any remarks on the first head.</p>

<p>There is but one claim, that of Messrs. Nott &amp; Co., disallowed
by the Commissioners,&mdash;in which case application
has been made for a part of the surplus referred to. The
claimants allege that their agents in China were too far from
Macao, the place where the Commissioners met, to allow
them to appeal to the Minister in season. The Committee
will be enabled to judge of the sufficiency of this reason for
considering the claim in that case an open one.</p>

<p>The award in the Caldera case is the only one complained of
as having been inadequate. As all the facts and arguments
in the case are embraced in the accompanying papers, <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>the
Committee can form their own opinion upon this point.</p>

<p>The Minister who concluded the convention pursued a judicious
course in requiring from the Chinese a sum in gross
adequate to meet the sums claimed in the several cases.
This, however, can hardly be allowed to imply, that, even
in his opinion, the claimants in those cases ought to receive
the amounts which severally they might expect.</p>

<p>Congress made it the duty of the Commissioners, by an investigation
judicial in its character, to ascertain the amounts
justly due; and if the claimants should be dissatisfied with
the decisions of the Commissioners, an appeal to the Minister
was allowed, whose decision was expected to be final.</p>

<p>The expediency of sanctioning a review of decisions of
the Commissioners or arbiter may be deemed questionable.
They were all of high character, peculiarly qualified for the
trust conferred upon them. It is for Congress to consider the
conveniences and inconveniences of such a precedent, when
the Government, in all its branches, may be considered to
have already fulfilled its duty to the claimants, collectively
and individually.</p>

<p>The whole subject is one of a purely legislative character,
affecting a fund which, although it came into the Treasury
in a peculiar manner, seems to me to belong to the United
States. This Department has no authority to inquire whether
there are equities existing on the part of any of our citizens
which Congress ought to consult in directing the disposition
of the fund. If Congress should impose any inquiry
of that nature upon the Department, it would undertake the
performance of it cheerfully and with a purpose only to consult
justice and the public advantage. But the Department
sees no ground for recommending such a measure in the present
case.</p>

CLAIMS SINCE THE AWARD.</h4>

<p>It remains to speak of claims which have been brought
forward or renewed since the awards were made.</p>

<p>One of these is that of Matthew Rooney, master of the
bark Caldera, which had been presented to the Commissioners,
but was not considered by them, in the absence of proof
of citizenship. In 1864 his representatives produced to Mr.
Burlingame evidence on this head, and the latter directed
that he should be paid in the same manner and proportion as
other persons interested in the same class of claims had been
paid by order of Mr. Ward, our Minister at Peking.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a></p>

<p>Mr. Burlingame says, in his dispatch reporting the action
which he had taken in this matter: “There is no other demand
that can ever come up for payment out of this Indemnity
Fund, which has not been examined and decided.”<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>Other claims have, however, been brought to notice. Some
of these are known as the Caldera claims; another is the Neva
or Nott &amp; Co.’s claim.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Caldera was a Chilian bark. On the 5th October,
1854, she sailed from Hong-Kong for San Francisco. During
the ensuing night she encountered a storm, by which she
was so injured as to be obliged to seek an anchorage. This
she found, on the 7th October, between islands lying off the
Chinese coast. Here she was attacked and plundered by successive
piratical bands. The captain escaped and made his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
way to Hong-Kong, when, upon his information, steps were
taken to recover the property and punish the pirates. A
small portion of the cargo was found, and summary justice
was inflicted upon such of the pirates as were captured.</p>

<p>The master of the Caldera was an American. An American
firm were shippers by her, and various American insurance
offices had taken risks upon the hull of the vessel and
the larger portion of her cargo. These all appealed to Mr.
McLane, then the chief diplomatic officer of the United
States in China, with a view to secure indemnity. Mr.
McLane declined to take action, declaring that our treaty
offered “no basis whatever on which to make a claim against
the Chinese Government,”<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> and referred the subject to Mr.
Marcy, then Secretary of State. The latter responded, under
date of October 5, 1855, “that the parties injured were entitled
to indemnification from the Government of China, if not
specially by treaty, at least by general principles of international
right and obligation.”<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> The same matter forms the
subject of a dispatch from Mr. Cass, Secretary of State, to
Mr. Ward, dated May 5, 1859, in which, after declaring that
“the decision of the case will rest with the Commissioners
and yourself,” and detailing certain allegations made to him
by the claimants, who appear to have been very active, he
says: “If facts of such a nature be proved, the responsibility
of the Chinese Government and its duty to make indemnity
would seem to be fixed, according to the treaty, as well as according
to the Law of Nations.”<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p>

<p>The matter was brought before the Commissioners in 1859,
and a patient hearing seems to have been given by them, the
result of which was a disagreement between them. Both
rendered elaborate opinions: one adjudging that no portion
of the claims should be allowed; the other, an opposite<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
view, and he proceeded to assess the damages sustained by
the claimants. These he estimated at forty per cent. of their
claim, holding that the vessel and her cargo had been injured
by the storm to the extent of sixty per cent. of their value.
The case then went before Mr. Ward, whose conclusion was
expressed in the following words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Under the instructions of Mr. Marcy, thus reaffirmed by Mr.
Cass, my duty may be discharged by ascertaining, as far as possible,
what have been ‘the actual losses of our citizens.’ Satisfied
with the award of Mr. Roberts on this point, I have approved the
same, and ordered the amounts awarded by him to be paid to the
respective claimants.”<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The amounts so paid exceeded $54,000 in coin. This
was received by the several claimants, and it does not appear
that they protested against the awards. Some of them were,
however, dissatisfied, and in 1863 addressed Mr. Burlingame,
setting forth their views, and asking him to favor their purpose
for a rehearing. Mr. Burlingame, as will be seen on
reference to his dispatch of October 5, 1863,<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> entered on a
thorough examination of their statements, and arrived at the
conclusion that the awards ought not to be disturbed, using
strong language in this sense.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The Neva was a British schooner. Messrs. Nott &amp; Co.
were American merchants, residing at Hong-Kong. On the
16th October, 1857, they shipped by the Neva, then bound
for the port of Foo-chow, five packages containing twenty
thousand Mexican dollars. The vessel sailed at 3 o’clock
P.M. of the 17th, and the same evening, while at anchor a
short distance beyond the limits of the port of Hong-Kong,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
five Chinese came alongside and requested passage to Foo-chow,
which was granted. At 11 o’clock that night these
Chinese and the Chinese members of the crew took possession
of the vessel; and having murdered the master and
some of the crew and secured the rest, they broke into the
hold, seized four of the packages of silver and removed them
to the shore. The efforts of Messrs. Nott &amp; Co. to recover
the treasure were unsuccessful; and finally, the firm having
ceased to exist, the agent representing their interests placed
the claim before the Commissioners, who rejected it. Correspondence
with the State Department ensued, and in 1869
the representatives of the firm appeared before Congress, declaring
that their agent was absent from the South of China,
where the Commissioners held their sittings, at the time when
the awards were made, and that they had then, innocently,
been deprived of their right to appeal from them to the Minister.
The Attorney-General was directed by Congress to examine
their claim, and, if in his judgment it was valid, he
was empowered to award its payment out of the Indemnity
Fund. The Attorney-General decided in favor of the claimants,
and directed payment of a certain sum in gold. Mr.
Washburne, then Secretary of State, held that he was not
authorized to make the payment in any other than current
funds of the United States. From this ruling the claimants
have lately appealed to the Court of Claims, which has
decided that the award of the Attorney-General should be
compl<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>ied with. This will make a small deduction from the
fund.</p>

<h2><a name="TAX_ON_BOOKS" id="TAX_ON_BOOKS"></a>TAX ON BOOKS.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, June 30, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>A bill “to reduce internal taxes and for other purposes” being
under consideration, Mr. Sumner moved to add to the free list of imports
“books in foreign or dead languages, of which no editions are
printed in the United States.” In conclusion of a running debate
relative to the application of this amendment, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Senators seem to argue that this is applicable exclusively,
or almost exclusively, to school-books;
but we are all aware that outside of school-books there
are works of literature, of instruction generally, of travels,
of romance if you please, interesting in families, and
which thousands who are familiar, for instance, with the
German language, would be glad to have. For example,
here is the large German population of our country,&mdash;is
it not right that they should have the means of adding
to those innocent recreations that are found in reading?
We shall be doing a real service to them, if we
enable them to import books that they lack, cheap,&mdash;not
merely school-books, but I mean the large class of
books outside of school-books. I see no possible objection
to this provision, while I see much in its favor.</p>

<p>I have alluded to the large German population. There
is also a very considerable Italian population. Some one
told me the other day, who professed to know, that there
are three hundred thousand Italians in our country.
That seemed to me very large; but it was an estimate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
made by an Italian. Now should not those Italians be
enabled under our tariff law to import books from their
own country, of literature or of science, without paying
a tax? It seems to me that we owe that gratification
to them, when they come here to join their fortunes to
ours. And so you may go through the whole list of
European nations. Take Spaniards; take Swedes; take
Danes: I know not why their books should be taxed,
when they come to them from across the sea. It seems
to me that the tax is inhospitable; it is churlish; and
of course it is a tax on knowledge.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The amendment was rejected.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner then moved to add,&mdash;“Also books with illustrations
relating to the sciences and the arts,”&mdash;saying:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>On that I wish to read a remark of an intelligent person
not belonging to the class that the Senator from
Ohio characterized as rich men who import books, but
one who imports books because he needs them. Remarking
on the works of science and the arts, including
books on architecture and the fine arts, which now pay
very heavily at the custom-house, he says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Books of this kind are too costly, and the sale of them is
too limited, for them to be reprinted. To add to their cost
by a heavy duty is an outrage, for it is depriving men of
small means of the tools whereby they live. It is a queer
kind of protection of home industry which seeks to keep out
of the country by taxation the knowledge which makes industry
valuable.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now I put it to Senators whether any injurious consequence
can result from allowing these books to come
in free. The duty that you receive from them is small;
it is very little for you to give up; but in givin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>g facilities
to the importation of such books you contribute to
knowledge. I am sure of it. I have no motive in making
this motion, or this succession of motions, except
my anxiety for the extension of knowledge in this Republic.
I am for free schools; I am for free knowledge
everywhere; and I wish to beat down all the obstructions
possible, and one of these is the tax which we impose
in our tariff. I hope there can be no question on
that amendment.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The vote being taken by yeas and nays resulted, Yeas 14, Nays 26;
so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span> this amendment was likewise rejected.</p>

ON ACCOUNT OF COLOR.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks in the Senate, July 2 and 4, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>July 2, 1870, the Senate having under consideration a bill “to amend
the Naturalization Laws and to punish crimes against the same,” which
had been reported from the Committee on the Judiciary as a substitute
for one from the House,&mdash;the particular object of both bills being the
prevention of the election frauds perpetrated through the instrumentality
of unnaturalized or illegally naturalized aliens,&mdash;Mr. Sumner
moved to add, as a new section, a bill previously introduced by himself,
and reported favorably from the same Committee, providing&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That all Acts of Congress relating to naturalization be, and the same
are hereby, amended by striking out the word ‘white’ wherever it occurs,
so that in naturalization there shall be no distinction of race or color.”</p>

</div>

<p>The motion was strenuously resisted, as ill-timed and out of place,&mdash;Mr.
Edmunds, of the Judiciary Committee, remarking, that, although
he reported the bill in question, and believed in it so far as
he now understood, yet, under existing circumstances, he should vote
against it as an amendment to the pending bill.</p>

<p>Mr. Sumner briefly responded:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The remark of the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>] renders it necessary
for me to make a brief statement. Some time
during the last Congress I had the honor of introducing
a bill to strike the word “white” from our Naturalization
Laws. I tried to have it put on its passage. I
was resisted then by the Senator from Vermont, who
moved its reference to the Committee on the Judiciary.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
There it remained until near the expiration of that Congress,
and was then reported adversely, too late for further
action. During the third week of the present Congress,
now more than a year ago, I introduced the same
bill again. It remained in the room of the Judiciary
Committee from March, 1869, until very recently, when
it was reported favorably.</p>

<p>Such, Sir, have been my efforts to bring the Senate
to a vote on this question. Never till this moment
has it been in my power to have a vote on a question
which I deem of vital importance. I have here on
my table letters from different States,&mdash;from California,
from Florida, from Virginia,&mdash;all showing a considerable
number of colored persons&mdash;shall I say of African
blood?&mdash;aliens under our laws, who cannot be naturalized
on account of that word “white.”</p>

<p>Now, Sir, here is a practical grievance which needs a
remedy. This is the first time that I have been able to
obtain a vote upon it; and I should be unworthy of my
seat here, if, because Senators rise and say they will
vote it down on the ground that it is out of place, I
should hesitate to persevere. Senators will vote as they
please; I shall vote for it. The Senator from Illinois
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Trumbull</span>] properly says it is in place. Never
was there a bill to which it was more germane. You
are now revising the naturalization system, and I propose
to strike out from that system a requirement disgraceful
to this country and to this age. I propose to
bring our system into harmony with the Declaration of
Independence and the Constitution of the United States.
The word “white” cannot be found in either of these
two great title-deeds of this Republic. How can you
place it in your statutes?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion was lost,&mdash;Yeas 22, Nays 23.</p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
<p>Subsequently, on the same day, the pending bill was itself defeated,
the original bill being preferred,&mdash;and the latter now coming up, Mr.
Sumner renewed his amendment, remarking,&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Now I have to say that that is worth all the rest of
the bill put together. That is a section that is pure
gold. It will do more for the character and honor and
good name of this Republic than all the rest of the bill.
I am for the rest of the bill, but this is better than all
the rest. Now I ask for the yeas and nays.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>After further debate the amendment prevailed,&mdash;Yeas 27, Nays 22;
whereupon Mr. Williams, of Oregon, moved the following addition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Provided</i>, That nothing in this Act shall be construed to authorize the
naturalization of persons born in the Chinese Empire.”</p>

</div>

<p>July 4th, the debate on the House bill being resumed, Mr. Conkling,
of New York, criticized sharply the course of Mr. Sumner in pressing
his amendment, to the peril of the bill,&mdash;denominating it “an act of
self-will in defeating the purpose of a great majority of this body to
consummate a simple, practical, and urgent measure.” Mr. Sumner
replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;The Senator from New York has
chosen to make an assault on me to-day, because, in the
discharge of my duties, I do not see my duty as he sees
his duty,&mdash;because on this Fourth day of July I choose
to stand by the Declaration of our fathers. For that I
am impeached by the Senator from New York.</p>

<p>He presses me to postpone this proposition until to-morrow.
When, Sir, will that to-morrow come? Can
the Senator tell? Is he adept enough to indicate the
day, or even the week, when a vote can be had on it?
The Senator knows, he must know, that, if not voted on
now, it will fail during the present session. The Senator
shakes his head; but he knows too much of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
business now before the Senate not to see that I am
right. What chance is there of getting before the Senate
the original bill containing this proposition? Why,
Sir, the bill was introduced first on the 19th of July,
1867, now three years ago. I tried then to put it on its
passage, deeming it so simple that there was no need of
a reference to any committee. The Senator from Vermont
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Edmunds</span>] prevailed against me by insisting
that it should be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
It was referred, and there it slumbered until
that Congress was about to close, thus sleeping the long
sleep.</p>

<p>On the 22d of March, 1869, which was in the next
Congress, I introduced the same bill again,&mdash;I have it
before me,&mdash;and again it slumbered in the hands of the
Judiciary Committee until a few weeks ago, when at
last it was reported to the Senate. Then it took its
place on the Calendar, with the numerous other bills
there, important and unimportant, some very important,
all in competition with it.</p>

<p>What chance have I had for a vote upon it? From
the 19th of July, 1867, down to this hour, Saturday
was the first day I was able to have a vote upon it;
and now to-day Senators insist that I shall withdraw it,
and postpone the whole question to some “to-morrow,”
some indefinite, unknown to-morrow.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow</div>
<div class="verse">Creeps in this petty pace from day to day,</div>
<div class="verse">To the last syllable of recorded time;</div>
<div class="verse">And all our yesterdays have lighted fools</div>
<div class="verse">The way to dusty death.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Sir, I am not one of those “fools.” I will not postpone
this question to any “to-morrow.” The Senate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
will do as they please; but, God willing, they shall
have an opportunity to vote on it. Vote as you please,
Sir, but the time has come for a vote.</p>

<p>Mr. President, this is not the only bill on the Calendar
which concerns the rights of colored persons. There
are two on the Calendar, and one now before the Judiciary
Committee. The first on the Calendar was reported
by me from the Committee on the District of
Columbia as long ago as February 8, 1870, and is entitled
“A bill to repeal the charter of the Medical Society
of the District of Columbia.” That society has
been guilty of an act which I have no hesitation, on all
the testimony before us, in declaring to be one of infamy,
for which they deserve the promptest judgment
of Congress, which shall take from them the power to
inflict indignity on their fellow-man. Enjoying a charter
from Congress which dedicates them and sets them
apart to the cultivation of medical science, they have
undertaken to exclude persons otherwise competent simply
on account of color. They have set up a test of
membership founded on color. The evidence is irrefutable;
and yet I have been unable to bring the Senate to
a vote on that bill; and meanwhile colored physicians
in this District are subjected to the indignity of exclusion
from the Society, and thus are shut out from opportunities
of medical instruction.</p>

<p>There is another bill, which I reported from the Committee
on the District of Columbia May 6, 1870, entitled
“A bill to secure equal rights in the public schools
of Washington and Georgetown.” That, also, I have
tried in vain to press upon the Senate. There is, then,
another bill, whic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>h I had the honor of introducing May
13, 1870, entitled “A bill supplementary to an Act entitled
‘An Act to protect all citizens of the United
States in their civil rights, and to furnish the means
for their vindication,’ passed April 9, 1866.” This important
bill was duly referred to the Committee on the
Judiciary, but I have heard nothing from it since. It
slumbers on the table of the Committee.</p>

<p>Of all these measures which concern equal rights,
the only one which I have been able to bring before
the Senate is that under consideration; and I am now
pressed to withdraw it so as to avoid a vote. Why, Sir,
again and again in other years have I been pressed in
the same way; again and again in other years have Senators
spoken to me and of me as the Senator from New
York was advised to speak to-day: but it has not been
my habit to yield; nor have I been alone, Sir, in such
determination. One of the most beautiful instances in
parliamentary history, familiar, doubtless, to the Chamber,
is that motion of Mr. Buxton in the House of Commons,
in 1832, which determined Emancipation. The
Ministry professed to be against Slavery; a large number
of the House of Commons made the same profession;
but they were against declaring it; and when Mr.
Buxton gave notice of a motion in favor of immediate
emancipation, Ministry, members of the House, and personal
friends came to him entreating that he would not
press his motion, especially that he would not divide
the House. One of his family records in his Memoirs,
which I have in my hands, says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“He was cruelly beset, and acutely alive to the pain of refusing
them, and, as they said, of embarrassing all their
measures, and giving their enemies a handle at this tottering
moment.”<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span></p>

<p>Then it is recorded of his friends in the House:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“‘They hated,’ they said, ‘dividing against him when
their hearts were all for him; it was merely a nominal difference;
why should he split hairs? He was sure to be
beaten; where was the use of bringing them all into difficulty,
and making them vote against him?’ He told us that
he thought he had a hundred applications of this kind in the
course of the evening; in short, nearly every friend he had
in the House came to him, and by all considerations of reason
and friendship besought him to give way.”<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a></p>

</div>

<p>On that occasion he wrote to the leader of the House
of Commons, Lord Althorp, under date of May 22, 1832,
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Allow me, moreover, to remind you, that, however insignificant
in myself, I am the representative, on this question,
of no mean body in this country, who would be, to an extent
of which I believe you have no idea, disappointed and chagrined
at the suspension of the question.”<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Sir, in a humble way I may adopt this language. I,
too, am the representative, on this question, of no mean
body in this country, who I know would be disappointed
and chagrined at the suspension of the question.
The English Emancipationist refused to yield; he insisted,
according to the language of Parliament, on dividing
the House. He was left in a minority, but that
vote determined Emancipation; and the Ministry and
those personal friends who had advised against his
course complimented him upon that firmness which
had at last assured the victory.</p>

<p>I doubt if Senators are aware of the practical bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
of this proposition on the Atlantic seaboard, and even
in California. I said on Saturday that I had letters
from various parts of the country attesting that there
are colored aliens shut out from equal rights by that
word “white” in our Naturalization Laws. I did not
then read the letters; but as this debate now promises
to extend, I deem it my duty to lay some of them before
the Senate.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. Sumner here read four letters,&mdash;two from Florida, one from
California, and another from Virginia.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such, Sir, is the personal testimony with regard to
the importance, I would say the necessity, of this measure.
Here are Africans in our country shut out from
rights which justly belong to them, simply because Congress
continues the word “white” in the Naturalization
Laws. These men are humble, but they are none the
less worthy of protection. Ay, Sir, it is your duty to
protect them. Even if few, you cannot afford to let
them suffer wrong; but they are numerous,&mdash;in Florida
counted by the hundred, and even the thousand.</p>

<p>Strong as this measure is, as an act of justice, whether
to many or few, it has another title. Its highest importance
is found in its conformity to the requirement of
the Declaration of Independence. Sir, this is the Fourth
of July, when our fathers together solemnly declared as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are
created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator with
certain unalienable rights; that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness; that to secure these rights
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>The great, the mighty words of this clause are, that
these self-evident, unalienable rights belong to “all
men.” It is “all men,” and not a race or color, that
are placed under protection of the Declaration; and
such was the voice of our fathers on the fourth day
of July, 1776. Sir, such was the baptismal vow of
this nation. According to this vow, <em>all men</em> are created
equal and endowed with unalienable rights. But the
statutes of the land assert the contrary,&mdash;they declaring
that only all <em>white</em> men are created equal.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, what better thing can you do on this anniversary
than to expunge from the statutes that unworthy
limitation which dishonors and defiles the original
Declaration? It is in your power to make the day
more than ever sacred.</p>

<p>How can you hesitate? There are the words. Does
any one question the text? Will any one move to
amend the text? Will any one insist that hereafter,
as these great words are read on our great anniversary,
the word “white” shall be inserted to qualify
this sublime Declaration? No one will venture such a
suggestion. There they are; there they will remain as
long as this Republic endures. But if you are not ready
to change the original text, you must then change your
statutes and bring them into harmony with the text.
The word “white,” wherever it occurs as a limitation
of rights, must disappear. Only in this way can you
be consistent with the Declaration.</p>

<p>Senators undertake to disturb us in this judgment
by reminding us of the possibility of large numbers
swarming from China; but the answer to all this is
very obvious and very simple. If the Chinese come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
here, they will come for citizenship or merely for labor.
If they come for citizenship, then in this desire do they
give a pledge of loyalty to our institutions; and where
is the peril in such vows? They are peaceful and industrious;
how can their citizenship be the occasion of
solicitude?</p>

<p>We are told that they are Imperialists; but before
they can be citizens they must renounce Imperialism.
We are told that they are foreigners in heart; but before
they can take part with us they must renounce
their foreign character. Therefore do I say, if they
come for citizenship, there is no peril,&mdash;while, if they
come merely for labor, then is all this discussion and all
this anxiety superfluous.</p>

<p>Why introduce the topic into debate? Is there a Senator
on this floor who will say that from anything done
or said by Chinese at this moment there is any reason
to fear peril to this Republic? Sir, the greatest peril to
this Republic is from disloyalty to its great ideas. Only
in this way can peril come. Let us surrender ourselves
freely and fearlessly to the principles originally declared.
Such is the way of safety. How grand, how beautiful,
how sublime is that road to travel! How mean, how
dark, how muddy is that other road which has found
counsellors to-day! Listening to the speech of the Senator
from Nevada [Mr. <span class="smcap">Stewart</span>], more than once, nay,
thrice over, denying the Declaration of Independence, I
was reminded of an incident in the Gospels. I have the
book from the desk of the Secretary, and now read the
pertinent passage: it is in Matthew, chapter twenty-six:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Now Peter sat without in the palace: and a damsel came
unto him, saying, Thou also wast with Jesus of Galilee.</p>

<p>“But he denied before them all, saying, I know not what
thou sayest.</p>

<p>“And when he was gone out into the porch another maid
saw him, and said unto them that were there, This fellow was
also with Jesus of Nazareth.</p>

<p>“And again he denied with an oath, I do not know the
man.</p>

<p>“And after a while came unto him they that stood by,
and said to Peter, Surely thou also art one of them; for
thy speech bewrayeth thee.</p>

<p>“Then began he to curse and to swear, saying, I know not
the man. And immediately the cock crew.</p>

<p>“And Peter remembered the words of Jesus, which said
unto him, Before the cock crow thou shalt deny me thrice.
And he went out, and wept bitterly.”</p>

</div>

<p>Sir, thrice has a Senator on this floor denied these
great principles of the Declaration of Independence.
The time may come when he will weep bitterly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>On a subsequent motion by Mr. Conkling for the reconsideration of
the vote on Mr. Sumner’s amendment, in consequence of the debate
ensuing upon Mr. Williams’s proviso, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The Senator from Oregon [Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span>], who spoke
with earnestness and with argumentative force this morning,
before the motion to reconsider was made, has given
us reasons why we should not admit the Chinese into
the promised fellowship of the Declaration of Independence.
I took down some of his precious words,&mdash;not
many.</p>

<p>He says that my proposition gives to millions of
heathens and pagans power to control our institutions.
How and when have I made any such proposition? I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
wish the Senator were here, that I might ask him to explain
this unjustifiable exaggeration. How and when?
I make no proposition that I do not find in the institutions
of my country. I simply ask you to stand by the
Declaration of your fathers. I say nothing about millions
of heathens and pagans. I do not ask to give
them power or control. Full well do I know that there
are no millions of heathens or pagans, and no other millions
on this earth, that can control the institutions of
this Republic. I know that we stand too firm to suffer
from any such contact. Fearlessly we may go forward
and welcome all comers, for there can be no harm here;
the heathens and pagans do not exist whose coming
can disturb our Republic. Worse than any heathen
or pagan abroad are those in our midst who are false
to our institutions. Millions of heathens and pagans!
Whence are they to come? From China? But if they
come for citizenship, then, as I said this morning, do
they give the pledge of loyalty to the Republic; and
how can you fear them, if they enter your courts and
with oaths and witnesses ask to be incorporated with
our citizenship?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Stewart.</span> Allow me to ask the Senator if he knows
any way in which they can give a pledge that they would
understand as binding on them?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Precisely as an Englishman, a Scotchman,
an Irishman, a Frenchman, a German, a Swede, a
Dane, a Russian, or an African may give a pledge; precisely
as the Senator may give a pledge. I have seen
the Senator go up to that table and take the oath. The
Senator is able. He knows that I know that; but does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the Senator suppose that he surpasses in ability many
of the Chinese who might come here? Does the Senator
suppose that he feels more keenly the oath which he
took at that desk than a Chinese might feel it? I am
not speaking of those who may come over here in enforced
labor: I join with the Senator in effort to stop
that. But I am speaking of the intelligent Chinese, so
well and satisfactorily described by the Senator from
Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Schurz</span>] this morning, who come voluntarily
to join their fortunes with ours. Suppose they
come, where is the peril? Sir, it is against common
sense to imagine peril from such a source.</p>

<p>The Senator from Missouri has shown you how slowly
they must come, according to the natural order of
things,&mdash;how many decades of years it must take before
there will be a million of them, while meantime
our population is swelling by unknown millions, so that
when we have a solitary million of Chinese we shall
have one hundred millions of intelligent Americans
treading this continent. And yet the Senator from Nevada
is afraid. “What! a soldier, and afraid!” What!
a Senator of the United States anxious about a million
of Chinese twenty-five or thirty years from now absorbed
in that mighty one hundred millions which will
then compose our population! The Senator is not in
earnest; he cannot be. He was certainly excited in
speech, if I may judge from manner; but I really believe,
that, in quiet thought reviewing this whole question,
he will see that he has hastily taken counsel of
fear rather than of reason. Let the Senator put trust in
the Republic, and those ideas which are its strength and
glory.</p>

<p>The Senator from Oregon wound up another passage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
by charging me and those who voted with me, particularly
myself, with an intention, or with conduct calculated,&mdash;I
quote now his own words,&mdash;“to put the destinies
of this nation into the hands of Joss-worshippers.”
Sir, that is a strong, pungent phrase; but is it true?
Who here proposes any such thing? How can Joss-worshippers
obtain control of the destinies of this nation?
Will any Senator be good enough to tell me?
By what hocus-pocus, by what necromancy, by what
heathen magic will these Joss-worshippers obtain the
great ascendency? Why, Sir, it is to disparage this Republic
of ours, it is to belittle it, when you imagine any
such thing. The peril exists only in imagination; it is
an illusion, not a reality.</p>

<p>Then the Senator proceeded to denounce the Chinese
as Imperialists and Pagans. Pagans perhaps,&mdash;though
Senators who have ever looked into those books which
have done so much for the Chinese mind will hesitate
before they use harsh language in speaking of their belief.
Has any Senator read the system of Confucius,
uttered before that of the Saviour, and yet containing
truths marvellously in harmony with those which fell
from his lips? Throughout this great, populous empire
the truths of Confucius have been ever regarded as we
regard our Scriptures. They are the lesson for the
young and the old, and the rule for government and for
rulers; they are full of teachings of virtue. And yet
the Chinese are called Pagans! Imperialists they may
be while they remain in China, for their ruler is an Emperor.
But what are Frenchmen? Are they not Imperialists?
What are Russians? Are they not Imperialists?
And yet will any Senator rise here and say
that a Frenchman, that a Russian, shall not be admitted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
to naturalization? I take it not. Of course the Frenchman,
the Russian, and the Chinese will begin by renouncing
Imperialism. Therefore it is perfectly idle to
say that he is an Imperialist.</p>

<p>The Senator then blazed forth with a fulmination:
“Let the people of Massachusetts know that her Senator
is willing that Chinese should come to Massachusetts.”
Those were his words. Well, Sir, I think the
people of Massachusetts know their Senator well enough
to be assured that he is willing to have justice on this
earth. Let the gates of Massachusetts be open always.
God forbid that any system of exclusion should find
place there, such as I have heard vindicated by the
Senator from Oregon to-day! Be just to all men, and
all will be safe. The people of Massachusetts are intelligent,
generous, truthful; and they long to see the great
ideas of the Republic established beyond change. They
desire to see the Declaration of Independence no longer
a promise, but a living letter. Therefore it is perfectly
vain for the Senator to flash to Massachusetts that her
Senator here is in favor of justice to the Chinese.</p>

<p>The Senator says again that I am inviting their
competition. I make no invitation. That is not my
office. What am I, Sir? I have no power, as I have
no disposition, to speak any such invitation. My office
is entirely different. I stand here on the ancient
ways,&mdash;those ways that were laid down by the Fathers
of the Republic, and where I wish forevermore to keep
the Republic sure. I stand by the Declaration of Independence.
Sir, these are no ideas of mine; I am
speaking nothing from myself; I am only speaking
from the history of my country, and from the great
Declaration of the Fathers. That is all. I insist that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
at this day, at this stage of our history, the statutes of
the land shall be brought into harmony with the Constitution
of the United States and the Declaration of
Independence.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, I say that in those two great title-deeds of
the Republic,&mdash;and that is the term by which I shall
always designate them,&mdash;one interpreting the other,
there is no single word which can sanction any exclusion
on account of race or color.</p>

<p>Here allow me to mention an incident. You may
remember, some of you, that during the Rebellion the
question occurred, whether a colored officer of the Army
was entitled to pay. The question came before President
Lincoln, and, at my suggestion, was by him referred
to the Attorney-General, at that time Mr. Bates,
of Missouri. At the request of President Lincoln, I
called on Mr. Bates, to confer with him on his opinion.
I did not know then how strongly he inclined to what I
will call the side of justice. So I began my conversation
interrogatively, when he turned upon me, saying, “Will
you allow me to ask you a question?” “Certainly,”
said I. Said he, “Mr. Senator, is there anything in
the Constitution of the United States to prevent a negro
from being President?” The question took me by
surprise, coming from the Attorney-General. I replied,
promptly, “Of course, Mr. Attorney, there is nothing.”
“Well, you are right; of course there is nothing in the
Constitution to prevent a negro from being President;
how, then, can there be anything to prevent a negro
from being an officer, and receiving his pay as such?”
I replied at once to the Attorney-General, that I thought
he needed no suggestion from me on that question. I
left him; and you may remember the opinion which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
followed shortly after, in which he affirmed that colored
officers were entitled to pay in the Army of the United
States.<a name="FNanchor_150_150" id="FNanchor_150_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a></p>

<p>Sir, there is nothing in the Constitution of the United
States to prevent a negro from being President. On the
contrary, that Constitution, interpreted as it must be by
the Declaration of Independence, opens the way to all
men without distinction of race or color. No, Sir, I
am not the author of that doctrine. I had nothing to
do with it. I find it, and now simply present it to
the Senate. But, presenting it to the Senate, I insist
that you shall see to it that the existing statutes are
brought into conformity with the text of the Constitution,
and with the Declaration of Independence: that
is all. Strike out the word “white,” which nowhere
appears in the Constitution, and which is positively
prohibited by the Declaration of Independence. That
is what you are to do. So doing, you will complete the
work of harmony.</p>

<p>The Senator from Kansas [Mr. <span class="smcap">Pomeroy</span>], in that
speech, this evening, which to my mind was in many
respects exquisite with most beautiful thought and with
unanswerable argument, has taught the Senate, what I
have said again and again in debates in this Chamber
and in other places, that nothing can be settled which
is not right. And so this question will never be settled
until it is settled according to the great principles of
justice. Vainly you try, you cannot succeed. And
now, Sir, I do entreat Senators,&mdash;I hope they will
pardon me; I mean to say only what it belongs to a
Senator to say,&mdash;I do entreat Senators not to lose th<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>is
precious opportunity of completing the harmony of the
statutes of the land with the Constitution of the United
States and the Declaration of Independence. Only in
this way can you have peace. Let us have peace. Sir,
I tell you how you may have it. Adopt the amendment
which I have proposed, strike out the word “white,” and
the harmony will begin. The country will straightway
accept the result. But reject that amendment, and you
open at once the floodgates of controversy. From this
time the debate will proceed, and what is said here will
find its echoes and reverberations throughout the whole
land and be returned to us from the Pacific coast, never
to die out until the good cause prevails and all the
promises of the Fathers are fulfilled.</p>

<p>Why, Sir, the words of the Declaration of Independence
were not uttered in vain. Do you suppose them
idle? Do you suppose them mere phrase or generality?
No such thing. They are living words, by which this
country is solemnly bound, and from which it can never
escape until they are all fulfilled. Your statutes cannot
contain any limitation which inflicts an indignity upon
any portion of the human family.</p>

<p>Therefore do I entreat you, Senators, do not lose this
precious opportunity. It comes to you now unexpectedly,
perhaps; but what is there in life more golden
than opportunity, whether to country, to community, or
to individuals? It is what each of us covets, as he
treads along the highway of the world. It is what we
covet for our country. Here, Sir, you have golden opportunity.
Use it. Use it wisely; use it bravely; use
it so that you will secure peace, harmony, and reconciliation.
Beautiful words! All these are within your
power, if you now let it be known that you will s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>tand
by the Declaration to the end. You cannot suffer,
there can be no peril, no harm from any such dedication,&mdash;nothing
but gain. All our institutions will be
assured in proportion as you respect these great principles.
Reconstruction will have new strength, when you
show this homage to human nature.</p>

<p>And yet in the face of all this we are now asked to
retreat,&mdash;to retrace the steps already taken,&mdash;to reconsider
the vote that has been adopted,&mdash;and to confirm
in the statutes those words which are there without any
sanction in the Constitution, and in defiance of the Declaration
of Independence. Sir, I will not believe that
the Senate will do any such thing until the vote is recorded.
But whatever may be the result, I give notice
that I shall not cease my effort,&mdash;I shall continue it
to the end. I am a soldier for the war; and until I
see this great Declaration a living letter, I shall never
intermit my endeavors. I shall go forward, and on
every possible occasion I shall press the Senate to
another vote. But I trust the Senate will not reconsider
what they have done, but that they will settle this
great question so that it shall never again disturb our
debates.</p>

<p>Something I might say here on the “practical.” Some
Senator to-day has said something about being practical,
taking to himself great credit on this account. Of
course I who make this effort am not practical! I simply
strive to bring the statutes into harmony with the
Constitution and the Declaration of Independence; but
that is not practical! Our fathers were not practical,
when they put forth the great Declaration! Our fathers
were not practical, when they established the Constitution
without the word “white”! Of course I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
not practical, because I humbly strive to imitate the
Fathers! Now, Sir, which is the more practical,&mdash;to
allow this word to remain, breeding debate, controversy,
strife, or at once to strike it out and complete our great
work of Reconstruction? This is something to do. Tell
me not that it is not practical. Is there anything in the
bill that is equally practical? There are provisions, as
I said this morning, for the safeguard of naturalization,
which I value much; but how small in value, compared
with the establishment of that great principle which
fixes forevermore the fundamental idea of the Republic!
Is not that practical? Why, Sir, the two cannot be
compared. Both are important; but the first belongs to
the class of policies or expedients, and not of principles.
Adopt it, and you will help the machinery of naturalization,
which I desire to do. But strike out the word
“white” from your statutes, and you will do an act of
justice whose influence will be immeasurable. The Republic
will be exalted, and all our institutions will have
new strength and security.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>The motion for reconsideration prevailed,&mdash;Yeas 27, Nays 13.</p>

<p>The question now recurring on the adoption of the amendment, Mr.
Sumner rose to speak again,&mdash;whereupon a debate sprang up as to his
right to do so under the rules, finally terminated by the withdrawal of
an appeal which had been taken from a decision of the President <i>pro
tempore</i> affirming such right, when he was allowed to proceed. Beginning
with some remarks upon this episode, Mr. Sumner said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>The appeal is withdrawn; but I believe I have the
floor on the question. We have pending before us the
Tax Bill, and during a day perhaps a dozen or twenty
propositions are moved on that bill. According to the
suggestion of the Senator from New York [Mr. <span class="smcap">Conkling</span>],
one who had spoken on two of those propositions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
would be debarred from speaking on any of the others
during that day. As a Senator suggests to me, if a Senator
had spoken about salt or tea, then he could not
speak on sugar, or the income question, or anything
else. I believe the rule of the Senate will not compel
us to any such absurdity.</p>

<p>I do not like to take up the time of the Senate; and
I should not speak now, except for my desire to bring
home to the Senate once more the gravity of the question,
and to introduce a new authority, which I had on
my table, but which I forgot to use, when I was up before,&mdash;I
mean the late Abraham Lincoln. He, too, had
a great controversy in Illinois with a distinguished representative
of the Democratic party (Mr. <span class="smcap">Douglas</span>) on
the Declaration of Independence. Let Mr. Douglas
state his position in his own words. He said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I believe that this Government of ours was founded on
the white basis. I believe that it was established by white
men, by men of European birth, or descended of European
races, for the benefit of white men and their posterity in all
time to come. I do not believe that it was the design or intention
of the signers of the Declaration of Independence or
the framers of the Constitution to include negroes, Indians,
or other inferior races, with white men, as citizens.”<a name="FNanchor_151_151" id="FNanchor_151_151"></a><a href="#Footnote_151_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, in another place, Mr. Douglas said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Declaration of Independence only included the white
people of the United States.”<a name="FNanchor_152_152" id="FNanchor_152_152"></a><a href="#Footnote_152_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How like what we have heard in this Chamber <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>on Saturday
and to-day! Senators have been unconsciously
repeating these exploded arguments of the late Mr.
Douglas.</p>

<p>How did Abraham Lincoln answer? In a speech at
Springfield, while admitting that negroes are “not our
equals in color,” this eminent citizen, afterward President,
thus spoke for the comprehensive humanity of
the Declaration:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I adhere to the Declaration of Independence. If Judge
Douglas and his friends are not willing to stand by it, let
them come up and amend it. Let them make it read that
all men are created equal except negroes. Let us have it decided
whether the Declaration of Independence in this blessed
year of 1858 shall be thus amended. In his construction
of the Declaration last year, he said it only meant that
Americans in America were equal to Englishmen in England.
Then, when I pointed out to him that by that rule he excludes
the Germans, the Irish, the Portuguese, and all the
other people who have come amongst us since the Revolution,
he reconstructs his construction. In his last speech he
tells us it meant Europeans. I press him a little further, and
ask if it meant to include the Russians in Asia; or does he
mean to exclude that vast population from the principles of
our Declaration of Independence? I expect ere long he will
introduce another amendment to his definition. He is not at
all particular. He is satisfied with anything which does not
endanger the nationalizing of negro slavery. It may draw
white men down, but it must not lift negroes up.”<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Then, again, in another speech, made at Alton, the future
President renewed his testimony as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I assert that Judge Douglas and all his friends may
search the whole records of the country, and it will be a matter
of great astonishment to me if they shall be able to find
that one human being three years ago had ever uttered the
astounding sentiment that the term ‘all men’ in the Declaration
did not include the negro. Do not let me be misunderstood.
I know that more than three years ago there were
men who, finding this assertion constantly in the way of their
schemes to bring about the ascendency and perpetuation of
Slavery, denied the truth of it. I know that Mr. Calhoun,
and all the politicians of his school, denied the truth of the
Declaration. I know that it ran along in the mouth of some
Southern men for a period of years, ending at last in that
shameful, though rather forcible, declaration of Pettit, of Indiana,
upon the floor of the United States Senate, that the
Declaration of Independence was in that respect ‘a self-evident
lie,’ rather than a self-evident truth. But I say, with
a perfect knowledge of all this hawking at the Declaration
without directly attacking it, that three years ago there never
had lived a man who had ventured to assail it in the sneaking
way”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">That is not my language; it is the language of Abraham
Lincoln&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“of pretending to believe it and then asserting it did not include
the negro.”<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Lifted by the great cause in which he was engaged,
he appealed to his fellow-countrymen in tones of pathetic
eloquence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Think nothing of me,”&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">said he, afterward martyr,&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">“take no thought for the political fate of any man whomsoever,
but come back to the truths that are in the Declaration
of Independence. You may do anything with me you
choose, if you will but heed these sacred principles. You
may not only defeat me for the Senate, but you may take
me and put me to death. While pretending no indifference
to earthly honors, I do claim to be actuated in this contest
by something higher than an anxiety for office. I charge
you to drop every paltry and insignificant thought for any
man’s success. It is nothing, I am nothing, Judge Douglas
is nothing; but do not destroy that immortal emblem of humanity,
the Declaration of American Independence.”<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

</div>

<p>How apt are these words now! “Do not destroy
that immortal emblem of humanity, the Declaration of
American Independence.”</p>

<p>Then, again, as he was on his way to Washington,
stopping at Philadelphia to raise the flag of his country
over the Hall of Independence, he uttered these pathetic,
though unpremeditated words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“All the political sentiments I entertain have been drawn,
so far as I have been able to draw them, from the sentiments
which originated in, and were given to the world from, this
Hall. I have never had a feeling, politically, that did not
spring from the sentiments embodied in the Declaration of
Independence.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“Now, my friends, can this country be saved upon that
basis? If it can, I shall consider myself one of the happiest
men in the world, if I can help to save it.… But if this
country cannot be saved without giving up that principle, I
was about to say I would rather be assassinated on this spot
than surrender it.”<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a></p>

</div>

<p>And yet that is the principle which the Senate is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
now about to give up,&mdash;that principle which Abraham
Lincoln said, rather than give up he would be assassinated

<p>Then, after adding that he had not expected to say a
word, he repeated the consecration of his life, exclaiming,&mdash;</p>

<h2><a name="THE_REPUBLICAN_PARTY_ITS_PAST_AND" id="THE_REPUBLICAN_PARTY_ITS_PAST_AND"></a>THE REPUBLICAN PARTY: ITS PAST AND
FUTURE WORK.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech at a Ratification Meeting in Faneuil Hall,
October 15, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>October 15, 1870, the Republicans of Boston met in Faneuil Hall,
to ratify the nomination of candidates for State offices. The Hall was
filled to its utmost capacity, and Mr. Sumner was announced as
President of the meeting. In its report of the proceedings, the
“Journal” newspaper of the next day stated that Mr. Sumner, on taking
the chair, “was greeted with almost indescribable enthusiasm, and
it was some minutes before the audience permitted him to speak.” He
spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">FELLOW-CITIZENS,&mdash;In opening this meeting
to-night I am impressed by one thought, which
I would, if I could, have uppermost in the minds of
the people, so that they could not forget it at the coming
election. It is the necessity of constant, incessant,
persevering activity in support of Republican principles,
and of the party which maintains them. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>And here let me say that I know no way in which
Republican principles can be adequately supported,
without supporting the Republican party. [<i>Applause.</i>]
There is no local issue justifying opposition to the
Republican party, which, if it fails to do all that good
men desire, yet does more than can be accomplished<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
through any other political organization. Therefore do
I say, Stand by the Republican party. Make it united
and vigorous. There must be no hesitation, or listlessness,
or desertion. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<p>Our majorities in Massachusetts are large, but so are
our responsibilities. From the historic character of
the Commonwealth, from the position it has occupied
in the warfare with Slavery, and from its fame as the
home of ideas, we cannot afford to be sluggish or indifferent;
nor can we break up into disjointed squads. It
is not enough, if we give a majority sufficient to elect
our candidates; we must make the majority commanding,
controlling, so as to be an example and a power in
the land. Massachusetts ideas and interests are to be
maintained and advanced, not merely here at home, but
in the nation. Besides State officers, we choose at this
election members of Congress, and a Legislature which
will elect a Senator of the United States. Therefore
must we regard our duties to the nation, the first of
which is to make Massachusetts the bulwark of the
national cause.</p>

<p>I know no good reason why Governor Claflin [<i>cheers</i>]
should not be reëlected unanimously, or at least without
opposition outside the Democratic party, which is
against him more from force of habit, I take it, than
anything else. As for others, who do not assume the
name of Democrats, they can find no excuse of habit in
voting against him. Then come the Republican candidates
for Congress, who, like the Governor, are entitled
to your best support. Faneuil Hall is now thronged
with the constituents of Mr. Hooper and Mr. Twichell,
[<i>renewed cheers</i>,] who know their services, so that my
testimony is not needed. I will only say, Fortunate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
the districts with Representatives having the character,
ability, and business capacity of these gentlemen. In
choosing a Legislature you will not forget my colleague,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Wilson</span>,] with his lifelong devotion to the slave,
his hard work against the Rebellion, and his practical
labors everywhere. [<i>Loud and prolonged applause.</i>]</p>

<p>I would add one further word in reply to those who
insist that the Republican party has done its work, and
therefore may die. Nothing more absurd. It has done
a great and ever-memorable work; but much remains to
be done. It has put down a terrible Rebellion waged by
Slavery; it has secured equal rights at the ballot-box
and in courts without distinction of color; and it has
reconstructed the Rebel States on the solid foundation
of the Declaration of Independence. [<i>Applause.</i>] Besides
these heroic achievements, which cannot be forgotten
so long as men throb in sympathy with human
rights, the Republican party has provided homesteads
for the needy; it has built a Pacific Railroad, binding
two oceans together; it has by honest payment reduced
the enormous national debt entailed by the Rebellion, and
at the same time it has reduced taxation. [<i>Applause.</i>]
If a political party is to be judged by what it has done,
then may the Republican party fearlessly ask your
votes.</p>

<p>But there is another reason for your continued support.
The whole work of Reconstruction and the establishment
of Equal Rights is still disputed and assailed
by the Democratic party. I might quote resolutions
and words of orators showing how they still hold out.
Repudiators of the National Debt, they would repudiate
all that has been done for the National Union, and for
that Equality before the Law which is one of our greatest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
triumphs and safeguards. [<i>Cheers.</i>] This is enough.
Until this new form of Repudiation is extinguished,
there is need of the Republican party. So long as anybody
assails the Declaration of Independence, the Republican
party cannot cease its patriotic labors.</p>

<p>It is foolish to imagine that this great party, consecrated
to Human Rights, can die. It will live as long
as people cherish those sublime truths declared by our
fathers, of which it is the representative and guardian.
Its special work will be always to stand by the nation
in its unity, and by the people in their rights. [<i>Applause.</i>]
For such a party there can be no decay. Men
whom I now address may grow old, but the Republican
party will be ever young. [<i>Applause.</i>]</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>In conclusion, Mr. Sumner introduced <span class="smcap">General Hawley</span> in the
following terms:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p>Let me introduce to your notice at this time General
Hawley, (or Governor Hawley, if you would rather,
for both titles belong to him,) of Connecticut, who
has stood by his principles both at home and on the
battle-field. [<i>Applause.</i>] And now, in introducing him,
I am going to ask him to pardon me for a revelation
which I believe will not be painful to the audience. I
want to give you a passage from a letter addressed to
myself by Mr. Hawley, at a time when he was much
younger than he is now, bearing date Hartford, May,
1854. It was written on receipt of intelligence by
telegraph that the life of a Senator was threatened at
Washington by mobs. Mr. Hawley addressed a letter to
that Sen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>ator, in which, after setting forth the telegram,
he said: “Please write to me at once, and say if you
need any defenders; if you do, I will be on the spot
early.”<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> [<i>Tremendous applause.</i>] This was written,
Fellow-Citizens, so long ago as 1854; it was seven years
before the war; yet General Hawley was then ready to
meet the foe. [<i>Applause.</i>] Gentlemen, I have the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>honor of introducing him to you.</p>

<h3>LECTURE.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;I am to speak of the Duel
between France and Germany, with its Lesson to
Civilization. In calling the terrible war now waging
a Duel, I might content myself with classical authority,
<i>Duellum</i> being a well-known Latin word for War.
The historian Livy makes a Roman declare that affairs
are to be settled “by a pure and pious duel”;<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> the
dramatist Plautus has a character in one of his plays
who obtains great riches “by the duelling art,”<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> meaning
the art of war; and Horace, the exquisite master
of language, hails the age of Augustus with the Temple
of Janus closed and “free from duels,”<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> meaning at
peace,&mdash;for then only was that famous temple shut.</p>


<h4>WAR UNDER THE LAW OF NATIONS A DUEL.</h4>

<p>But no classical authority is needed for this designation.
War, as conducted under International Law,
between two organized nations, is in all respects a
duel, according to the just signification of this word,&mdash;differing
from that between two individuals only in the
number of combatants. The variance is of proportion
merely, each nation being an individual who appeals <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>to
the sword as Arbiter; and in each case the combat is
subject to rules constituting a code by which the two
parties are bound. For long years before civilization
prevailed, the code governing the duel between individuals
was as fixed and minute as that which governs the
larger duel between nations, and the duel itself was
simply a mode of deciding questions between individuals.
In presenting this comparison I expose myself to
criticism only from those who have not considered this
interesting subject in the light of history and of reason.
The parallel is complete. Modern war is the duel of
the Dark Ages, magnified, amplified, extended so as to
embrace nations; nor is it any less a duel because the
combat is quickened and sustained by the energies of
self-defence, or because, when a champion falls and lies
on the ground, he is brutally treated. An authentic
instance illustrates such a duel; and I bring before you
the very pink of chivalry, the Chevalier Bayard, “the
knight without fear and without reproach,” who, after
combat in a chosen field, succeeded by a feint in driving
his weapon four fingers deep into the throat of his adversary,
and then, rolling with him, gasping and struggling,
on the ground, thrust his dagger into the nostrils
of the fallen victim, exclaiming, “Surrender, or you are
a dead man!”&mdash;a speech which seemed superfluous;
for the second cried out, “He is dead already; you have
conquered.” Then did Bayard, brightest among the
Sons of War, drag his dead enemy from the field, crying,
“Have I done enough?”<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a> Now, because the brave
knight saw fit to do these things, the combat was n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>ot
changed in original character. It was a duel at the
beginning and at the end. Indeed, the brutality with
which it closed was the natural incident of a duel. A
combat once begun opens the way to violence, and the
conqueror too often surrenders to the Evil Spirit, as
Bayard in his unworthy barbarism.</p>

<p>In likening war between nations to the duel, I follow
not only reason, but authority also. No better
lawyer can be named in the long history of the English
bar than John Selden, whose learning was equalled only
by his large intelligence. In those conversations which
under the name of “Table-Talk” continue still to instruct,
the wise counsellor, after saying that the Church
allowed the duel anciently, and that in the public liturgies
there were prayers appointed for duellists to say,
keenly inquires, “But whether is this lawful?” And
then he answers, “If you grant any war lawful, I make
no doubt but to convince it.”<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> Selden regarded the
simple duel and the larger war as governed by the same
rule. Of course the exercise of force in the suppression
of rebellion, or in the maintenance of laws, stands
on a different principle, being in its nature a constabulary
proceeding, which cannot be confounded with the
duel. But my object is not to question the lawfulness
of war; I would simply present an image, enabling you
to see the existing war in its true character.</p>

<p>The duel in its simplest form is between two individuals.
In early ages it was known sometimes as the
Judicial Combat, and sometimes as Trial by Battle.
Not only points of honor, but titles to land, grave questions
of law, and even the subtilties of theology, were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
referred to this arbitrament,<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a>&mdash;just as now kindred
issues between nations are referred to Trial by Battle;
and the early rules governing the duel are reproduced
in the Laws of War established by nations to govern
the great Trial by Battle. Ascending from the individual
to corporations, guilds, villages, towns, counties,
provinces, we find that for a long period each of these
bodies exercised what was called “the Right of War.”
The history of France and Germany shows how reluctantly
this mode of trial yielded to the forms of reason
and order. France, earlier than Germany, ordained
“Trial by Proofs,” and eliminated the duel from judicial
proceedings, this important step being followed by
the gradual amalgamation of discordant provinces in
the powerful unity of the Nation,&mdash;so that Brittany
and Normandy, Franche-Comté and Burgundy, Provence
and Dauphiny, Gascony and Languedoc, with the
rest, became the United States of France, or, if you
please, France. In Germany the change was slower;
and here the duel exhibits its most curious instances.
Not only feudal chiefs, but associations of tradesmen
and of domestics sent defiance to each other, and sometimes
to whole cities, on pretences trivial as those
which have been the occasion of defiance from nation
to nation. There still remain to us Declarations of War
by a Lord of Frauenstein against the free city of Frankfort,
because a young lady of the city refused to dance
with his uncle,&mdash;by the baker and domestics of the
Margrave of Baden against Esslingen, Reutlingen, and
other imperial cities,&mdash;by the baker of the Count Palatine
Louis against the cities of Augsburg, Ulm, and
Rottweil,&mdash;by the shoe-blacks of the University of
Leipsic against the provost and other members,&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>
by the cook of Eppstein, with his scullions, dairy-maids,
and dish-washers, against Otho, Count of Solms.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> This
prevalence of the duel aroused the Emperor Maximilian,
who at the Diet of Worms put forth an ordinance
abolishing the right or liberty of Private War, and instituting
a Supreme Tribunal for the determination of
controversies without appeal to the duel, and the whole
long list of duellists, whether corporate or individual,
including nobles, bakers, shoe-blacks, and cooks, was
brought under its pacific rule. Unhappily the beneficent
reform stopped half-way, and here Germany was
less fortunate than France. The great provinces were
left in the enjoyment of a barbarous independence, with
the “right” to fight each other. The duel continued
their established arbiter, until at last, in 1815, by the
Act of Union constituting the Confederation or United
States of Germany, each sovereignty gave up the right
of war with its confederates, setting an example to the
larger nations. The terms of this important stipulation,
marking a stage in German unity, were as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The members of the Confederation further bind themselves
under no pretext to make war upon one another, or to
pursue their differences by force of arms, but to submit them
to the Diet.”<a name="FNanchor_166_166" id="FNanchor_166_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Better words could not be found for the United
States of Europe, in the establishment of that Great
Era when the Duel shall cease to be the recognized
Arbiter of Nations.</p>

<p>With this exposition, which I hope is not too long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>,
it is easy to see how completely a war between two
nations is a duel,&mdash;and, yet further, how essential it is
to that assured peace which civilization requires, that
the duel, which is no longer tolerated as arbiter between
individuals, between towns, between counties,
between provinces, should cease to be tolerated as such
between nations. Take our own country, for instance.
In a controversy between towns, the local law provides
a judicial tribunal; so also in a controversy between
counties. Ascending still higher, suppose a controversy
between two States of our Union; the National Constitution
establishes a judicial tribunal, being the Supreme
Court of the United States. But at the next stage
there is a change. Let the controversy arise between
two nations, and the Supreme Law, which is the Law
of Nations, establishes, not a judicial tribunal, but the
duel, as arbiter. What is true of our country is true of
other countries where civilization has a foothold, and
especially of France and Germany. The duel, though
abolished as arbiter at home, is continued as arbiter
abroad. And since it is recognized by International
Law and subjected to a code, it is in all respects an
Institution. War is an institution sanctioned by International
Law, as Slavery, wherever it exists, is an
institution sanctioned by Municipal Law. But this
institution is nothing but the duel of the Dark Ages,
prolonged into this generation, and showing itself in
portentous barbarism.</p>


<h4>WHY THIS PARALLEL NOW?</h4>

<p>Therefore am I right, when I call the existing combat
between France and Germany a Duel. I beg you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
to believe that I do this with no idle purpose of illustration
or criticism, but because I would prepare the
way for a proper comprehension of the remedy to be
applied. How can this terrible controversy be adjusted?
I see no practical method, which shall reconcile the
sensibilities of France with the guaranties due to Germany,
short of a radical change in the War System itself.
That Security for the Future which Germany
may justly exact can be obtained in no way so well as
by the disarmament of France, to be followed naturally
by the disarmament of other nations, and the substitution
of some peaceful tribunal for the existing Trial by
Battle. Any dismemberment, or curtailment of territory,
will be poor and inadequate; for it will leave
behind a perpetual sting. Something better must be
done.</p>


<h4>SUDDENNESS OF THIS WAR.</h4>

<p>Never in history has so great a calamity descended
so suddenly upon the Human Family, unless we except
the earthquake toppling down cities and submerging a
whole coast in a single night. But how small all that
has ensued from any such convulsion, compared with
the desolation and destruction already produced by this
war! From the first murmur to the outbreak was a
brief moment of time, as between the flash of lightning
and the bursting of the thunder.</p>

<p>At the beginning of July there was peace without
suspicion of interruption. The Legislative Body had
just discussed a proposition for the reduction of the annual
Army Contingent. At Berlin the Parliament was
not in session. Count Bismarck was at his country
home in Pomerania, the King enjoying himself at <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>Ems.
How sudden and unexpected the change will appear
from an illustrative circumstance. M. Prévost-Paradol,
of rare talent and unhappy destiny, newly appointed
Minister to the United States, embarked at Havre on
the 1st of July, and reached Washington on the morning
of the 14th of July. He assured me that when he
left France there was no talk or thought of war. During
his brief summer voyage the whole startling event
had begun and culminated. Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen
being invited to become candidate
for the throne of Spain, France promptly sent her defiance
to Prussia, followed a few days later by formal
Declaration of War. The Minister was oppressed by
the grave tidings coming upon him so unprepared, and
sought relief in self-slaughter, being the first victim of
the war. Everything moved with a rapidity borrowed
from the new forces supplied by human invention, and
the Gates of War swung wide open.</p>


<h4>CHALLENGE TO PRUSSIA.</h4>

<p>A few incidents exhibit this movement. It was on
the 30th of June, while discussing the proposed reduction
of the Army, that Émile Ollivier, the Prime-Minister,
said openly: “The Government has no kind of disquietude;
at no epoch has the maintenance of peace
been more assured; on whatever side you look, you see
no irritating question under discussion.”<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> In the same
debate, Garnier-Pagès, the consistent Republican, and
now a member of the Provisional Governmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>t, after
asking, “Why these armaments?” cried out: “Disarm,
without waiting for others: this is practical. Let the
people be relieved from the taxes which crush them,
and from the heaviest of all, the tax of blood.”<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> The
candidature of Prince Leopold seems to have become
known at Paris on the 5th of July. On the next day
the Duc de Gramont, of a family famous in scandalous
history, Minister of Foreign Affairs, hurries to the tribune
with defiance on his lips. After declaring for the
Cabinet that no foreign power could be suffered, by
placing one of its princes on the throne of Charles the
Fifth, to derange the balance of power in Europe, and
put in peril the interests and the honor of France, he
concludes by saying, in ominous words: “Strong in
your support, Gentlemen, and in that of the nation, we
shall know how to do our duty without hesitation and
without weakness.”<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> This defiance was followed by
what is called in the report, “general and prolonged
movement,&mdash;repeated applause”; and here was the
first stage in the duel. Its character was recognized at
once in the Chamber. Garnier-Pagès exclaimed, in
words worthy of memory: “It is dynastic questions
which trouble the peace of Europe. The people have
only reason to love and aid each other.”<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> Though
short, better than many long speeches. Crémieux, an
associate in the Provisional Government of 1848, insisted
that the utterance of the Minister was “a menace
of war”; and Emmanuel Arago, son of the great
Republican astronomer and mathematician, said that
the Minister “had declared war.”<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> These patriotic
representatives were not mistaken. The speech made
peace difficult, if not impossible. It was a challenge
to Prussia.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<h4>COMEDY.</h4>

<p>Europe watched with dismay as the gauntlet was
thus rudely flung down, while on this side of the Atlantic,
where France and Germany commingle in the
enjoyment of our equal citizenship, the interest was
intense. Morning and evening the telegraph made us
all partakers of the hopes and fears agitating the world.
Too soon it was apparent that the exigence of France
would not be satisfied, while already her preparations
for war were undisguised. At all the naval stations,
from Toulon to Cherbourg, the greatest activity prevailed.
Marshal MacMahon was recalled from Algeria,
and transports were made ready to bring back the
troops from that colony.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the candidature of Prince Leopold was
renounced by him. But this was not enough. The
King of Prussia was asked to promise that it should
in no event ever be renewed,&mdash;which he declined to
do, reserving to himself the liberty of consulting circumstances.
This requirement was the more offensive,
inasmuch as it was addressed exclusively to Prussia,
while nothing was said to Spain, the principal in the
business. Then ensued an incident proper for comedy,
if it had not become the declared cause of tragedy.
The French Ambassador, Count Benedetti, who, on intelligence
of the candidature, had followed the King
to Ems, his favorite watering-place, and there in successive
interviews pressed him to order its withdrawal,
now, on its voluntary renunciation, proceeding to urge
the new demand, and after an extended conversation,
and notwithstanding its decided refusal, seeki<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>ng, nevertheless,
another audience the same day on this subject,
his Majesty, with perfect politeness, sent him word by
an adjutant in attendance, that he had no other answer
to make than the one already given: and this refusal
to receive the Ambassador was promptly communicated
by telegraph, for the information especially of the different
German governments.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a></p>


<h4>PRETEXT OF THE TELEGRAM.</h4>

<p>These simple facts, insufficient for the slightest quarrel,
intolerable in the pettiness of the issue disclosed,
and monstrous as reason for war between two civilized
nations, became the welcome pretext. Swiftly, and
with ill-disguised alacrity, the French Cabinet took the
next step in the duel. On the 15th of July the Prime-Minister
read from the tribune a manifesto setting forth
the griefs of France,&mdash;being, first, the refusal of the
Prussian King to promise for the future, and, secondly,
his refusal to receive the French Ambassador, with the
communication of this refusal, as was alleged, “officially
to the Cabinets of Europe,” which was a mistaken
allegation:<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> and the paper concludes by announcing
that since the preceding day the Government had called
in the reserves, and that they would immediately take
the measures necessary to secure the interests, the safety,
and the honor of France.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> This was war.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span></p>
<p>Some there were who saw the fearful calamity, the
ghastly crime, then and there initiated. The scene that
ensued belongs to this painful record. The paper announcing
war was followed by prolonged applause.
The Prime-Minister added soon after in debate, that he
accepted the responsibility with “a light heart.”<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> Not
all were in this mood. Esquiros, the Republican, cried
from his seat, in momentous words, “You have a light
heart, and the blood of nations is about to flow!” To
the apology of the Prime-Minister, “that in the discharge
of a duty the heart is not troubled,” Jules Favre,
the Republican leader, of acknowledged moderation and
ability, flashed forth, “When the discharge of this duty
involves the slaughter of two nations, one may well
have the heart troubled!” Beyond these declarations,
giving utterance to the natural sentiments of humanity,
was the positive objection, most forcibly presented by
Thiers, so famous in the Chamber and in literature,
“that the satisfaction due to France had been accorded
her,&mdash;that Prussia had expiated by a check the grave
fault she had committed,”&mdash;that France had prevailed
in substance, and all that remained was “a question of
form,” “a question of susceptibility,” “questions of etiquette.”
The experienced statesman asked for the dispatches.
Then came a confession. The Prime-Minister
replied, that he had “nothing to communicate,&mdash;that, in
the true sense of the term, there had been no dispatches,&mdash;that
there were only verbal communications gathered
up in reports, which, according to diplomatic usage, are
not communicated.” Here Emmanuel Arago interrup<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>ted:
“It is on these reports that you make war!” The
Prime-Minister proceeded to read two brief telegrams
from Count Benedetti at Ems, when De Choiseul very
justly exclaimed: “We cannot make war on that ground;
it is impossible!” Others cried out from their seats,&mdash;Garnier-Pagès
saying, “These are phrases”; Emmanuel
Arago protesting, “On this the civilized world will
pronounce you wrong”; to which Jules Favre added,
“Unhappily, true!” Thiers and Jules Favre, with
vigorous eloquence, charged the war upon the Cabinet:
Thiers declaring, “I regret to be obliged to say that we
have war by the fault of the Cabinet”; Jules Favre
alleging, “If we have war, it is thanks to the politics of
the Cabinet; … from the exposition that has been
made, so far as the general interests of the two countries
are concerned, there is no avowable motive for war.”
Girault exclaimed, in similar spirit: “We would be
among the first to come forward in a war for the country,
but we do not wish to come forward in a dynastic
and aggressive war.” The Duc de Gramont, who on the
6th of July flung down the gauntlet, spoke once more
for the Cabinet, stating solemnly, what was not the fact,
that the Prussian Government had communicated to all
the Cabinets of Europe the refusal to receive the French
Ambassador, and then on this misstatement ejaculating:
“It is an outrage on the Emperor and on France; and
if, by impossibility, there were found in my country a
Chamber to bear and tolerate it, I would not remain five
minutes Minister of Foreign Affairs.” In our country
we have seen how the Southern heart was fired; so also
was fired the heart of France. The Duke descended
from the tribune amidst prolonged applause, with cries
of “Bravo!”&mdash;and at his seat (so says the report<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>) “received
numerous felicitations.” Such was the atmosphere
of the Chamber at this eventful moment. The orators
of the Opposition, pleading for delay in the interest of
peace, were stifled; and when Gambetta, the young and
fearless Republican, made himself heard in calling for
the text of the dispatch communicating the refusal to
receive the Ambassador, to the end that the Chamber,
France, and all Europe might judge of its character, he
was answered by the Prime-Minister with the taunt
that “for the first time in a French Assembly there
were such difficulties on a certain side in explaining <em>a
question of honor</em>.” Such was the case as presented by
the Prime-Minister, and on this question of honor he
accepted war “with a light heart.” Better say, with no
heart at all;&mdash;for whoso could find in this condition of
things sufficient reason for war was without heart.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>During these brief days of solicitude, from the 6th to
the 15th of July, England made an unavailing effort
for peace. Lord Lyons was indefatigable; and he was
sustained at home by Lord Granville, who as a last resort
reminded the two parties of the stipulation at the
Congress of Paris, which they had accepted, in favor of
Arbitration as a substitute for War, and asked them to
accept the good offices of some friendly power.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> This
most reasonable proposition was rejected by the French
Minister, who gave new point to the French case by
charging that Prussia “had chosen to declare that
France had been affronted in the person of her Ambassador,”
and then positively insisting that “it was this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
boast which was the <i>gravamen</i> of the offence.” Capping
the climax of barbarous absurdity, the French Minister
did not hesitate to announce that this “constituted an
insult which no nation of any spirit could brook, and
rendered it, much to the regret of the French Government,
impossible to take into consideration the mode
of settling the original matter in dispute which was
recommended by her Majesty’s Government.”<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a> Thus
was peaceful Arbitration repelled. All honor to the
English Government for proposing it!</p>

<p>The famous telegram put forward by France as the
<i>gravamen</i>, or chief offence, was not communicated to the
Chamber. The Prime-Minister, though hard-pressed,
held it back. Was it from conviction of its too trivial
character? But it is not lost to the history of the duel.
This telegram, with something of the brevity peculiar to
telegraphic dispatches, merely reports the refusal to see
the French Ambassador, without one word of affront or
boast. It reports the fact, and nothing else; and it is
understood that the refusal was only when this functionary
presented himself a second time in one day on
the same business. Considering the interests involved,
it would have been better, had the King seen him as
many times as he chose to call; yet the refusal was not
unnatural. The perfect courtesy of his Majesty on this
occasion furnished no cause of complaint. All that remained
for pretext was the telegram.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<h4>FORMAL DECLARATION OF WAR.</h4>

<p>The scene in the Legislative Body was followed by
the instant introduction of bills making additional appropriations
for the Army and Navy, calling out the
National Guard, and authorizing volunteers for the war.
This last proposition was commended by the observation
that in France there were a great many young people
liking powder, but not liking barracks, who would
in this way be suited; and this was received with applause.<a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
On the 18th of July there was a further
appropriation to the extent of 500 million francs,&mdash;440
millions being for the Army, and 60 for the Navy;
and an increase from 150 to 500 millions Treasury
notes was authorized.<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> On the 20th of July the Duc
de Gramont appeared once more in the tribune, and
made the following speech:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Conformably to customary rules, and by order of the
Emperor, I have invited the <i>Chargé d’Affaires</i> of France to
notify the Berlin Cabinet of our resolution to seek by arms
the guaranties which we have not been able to obtain by
discussion. This step has been taken, and I have the honor
of making known to the Legislative Body that in consequence
a state of war exists between France and Prussia, beginning
the 19th of July. This declaration applies equally to the
allies of Prussia who lend her the coöperation of their arms
against us.”<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here the French Minister played the part of trumpeter
in the duel, making proclamation before his champion
rode forward. According to the statement of Count<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
Bismarck, made to the Parliament at Berlin, this formal
Declaration of War was the solitary official communication
from France in this whole transaction, being the
first and only note since the candidature of Prince
Leopold.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> How swift this madness will be seen in a
few dates. On the 6th of July was uttered the first
defiance from the French tribune; on the 15th of July
an exposition of the griefs of France, in the nature
of a Declaration of War, with a demand for men and
money; on the 19th of July a state of war was declared
to exist.</p>

<p>Firmly, but in becoming contrast with the “light
heart” of France, this was promptly accepted by Germany,
whose heart and strength found expression in the
speech of the King at the opening of Parliament, hastily
assembled on the 19th of July. With articulation disturbed
by emotion and with moistened eyes, his Majesty
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Supported by the unanimous will of the German governments
of the South as of the North, we turn the more confidently
to the love of Fatherland and the cheerful self-devotion
of the German people, with a call to the defence
of their honor and their independence.”<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Parliament responded sympathetically to the King,
and made the necessary appropriations. And thus the
two champions stood front to front.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TWO HOSTILE PARTIES.</h4>

<p>Throughout France, throughout Germany, the trumpet
sounded, and everywhere the people sprang to arms,
as if the great horn of Orlando, after a sleep of ages,
had sent forth once more its commanding summons.
Not a town, not a village, that the voice did not penetrate.
Modern invention had supplied an ally beyond
anything in fable. From all parts of France, from all
parts of Germany, armed men leaped forward, leaving
behind the charms of peace and the business of life.
On each side the muster was mighty, armies counting
by the hundred thousand. And now, before we witness
the mutual slaughter, let us pause to consider the two
parties, and the issue between them.</p>

<p>France and Germany are most unlike, and yet the
peers of each other, while among the nations they are
unsurpassed in civilization, each prodigious in resources,
splendid in genius, and great in renown. No two nations
are so nearly matched. By Germany I now mean
not only the States constituting North Germany, but
also Würtemberg, Baden, and Bavaria of South Germany,
allies in the present war, all of which together
make about fifty-three millions of French hectares, being
very nearly the area of France. The population of
each is not far from thirty-eight millions, and it would
be difficult to say which is the larger. Looking at finances,
Germany has the smaller revenue, but also the
smaller debt, while her rulers, following the sentiment
of the people, cultivate a wise economy, so that here
again substantial equality is maintained with France.
The armies of the two, embracing regular troops and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
those subject to call, did not differ much in numbers,
unless we set aside the authority of the “Almanach de
Gotha,” which puts the military force of France somewhat
vaguely at 1,350,000, while that of North Germany
is only 977,262, to which must be added 49,949
for Bavaria, 34,953 for Würtemberg, and 43,703 for
Baden, making a sum-total of 1,105,867. This, however,
is chiefly on paper, where it is evident France
is stronger than in reality. Her available force at the
outbreak of the war probably did not amount to more
than 350,000 bayonets, while that of Germany, owing
to her superior system, was as much as double this
number. In Prussia every man is obliged to serve, and,
still further, every man is educated. Discipline and
education are two potent adjuncts. This is favorable
to Germany. In the Chassepot and needle-gun the
two are equal. But France excels in a well-appointed
Navy, having no less than 55 iron-clads, and 384 other
vessels of war, while Germany has but 2 iron-clads,
and 87 other vessels of war.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> Then again for long
generations has existed another disparity, to the great
detriment of Germany. France has been a nation,
while Germany has been divided, and therefore weak.
Strong in union, the latter now claims something more
than that <em>dominion of the air</em> once declared to be hers,
while France had the land and England the sea.<a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> The
dominion of the land is at last contested, and we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
saddened inexpressibly, that, from the elevation they
have reached, these two peers of civilization can descend
to practise the barbarism of war, and especially that the
land of Descartes, Pascal, Voltaire, and Laplace must
challenge to bloody duel the land of Luther, Leibnitz,
Kant, and Humboldt.</p>


<h4>FOLLY.</h4>

<p>Plainly between these two neighboring powers there
has been unhappy antagonism, constant, if not increasing,
partly from the memory of other days, and partly
because France could not bear to witness that German
unity which was a national right and duty. Often it
has been said that war was inevitable. But it has come
at last by surprise, and on “a question of form.” So it
was called by Thiers; so it was recognized by Ollivier,
when he complained of insensibility to a question of
honor; and so also by the Duc de Gramont, when he
referred it all to a telegram. This is not the first time
in history that wars have been waged on trifles; but
since the Lord of Frauenstein challenged the free city
of Frankfort because a young lady of the city refused
to dance with his uncle, nothing has passed more absurd
than this challenge sent by France to Germany
because the King of Prussia refused to see the French
Ambassador a second time on the same matter, and
then let the refusal be reported by telegraph. Here is
the folly exposed by Shakespeare, when Hamlet touches
a madness greater than his own in that spirit which
would “find quarrel in a straw when honor’s at the
stake,” and at the same time depicts an army</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Led by a delicate and tender prince,</div>
<div class="verse center">…</div>

<div class="verse"><em>Even for an egg-shell</em>.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">There can be no quarrel in a straw or for an egg-shell,
unless men have gone mad. Nor can honor in a civilized
age require any sacrifice of reason or humanity.</p>


<h4>UNJUST PRETENSION OF FRANCE TO INTERFERE WITH
THE CANDIDATURE OF HOHENZOLLERN.</h4>

<p>If the utter triviality of the pretext were left doubtful
in the debate, if its towering absurdity were not
plainly apparent, if its simple wickedness did not already
stand before us, we should find all these characteristics
glaringly manifest in that unjust pretension
which preceded the objection of form, on which France
finally acted. A few words will make this plain.</p>

<p>In a happy moment Spain rose against Queen Isabella,
and, amidst cries of “Down with the Bourbons!”
drove her from the throne which she dishonored. This
was in September, 1868. Instead of constituting a Republic
at once, in harmony with those popular rights
which had been proclaimed, the half-hearted leaders
proceeded to look about for a King; and from that
time till now they have been in this quest, as if it were
the Holy Grail, or happiness on earth. The royal
family of Spain was declared incompetent. Therefore
a king must be found outside,&mdash;and so the quest was
continued in other lands. One day the throne is offered
to a prince of Portugal, then to a prince of Italy, but
declined by each,&mdash;how wisely the future will show.
At last, after a protracted pursuit of nearly two years,
the venturesome soldier who is Captain-General and
Prime-Minister, Marshal Prim, conceives the idea of
offering it to a prince of Germany. His luckless<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span> victim
is Prince Leopold of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen, a
Catholic, thirty-five years of age, and colonel of the first
regiment of the Prussian foot-guards, whose father, a
mediatized German prince, resides at Düsseldorf. The
Prince had not the good sense to decline. How his
acceptance excited the French Cabinet, and became the
beginning of the French pretext, I have already exposed;
and now I come to the pretension itself.</p>

<p>By what title did France undertake to interfere with
the choice of Spain? If the latter was so foolish as to
seek a foreigner for king, making a German first among
Spaniards, by what title did any other power attempt to
control its will? To state the question is to answer it.
Beginning with an outrage on Spanish independence,
which the Spain of an earlier day would have resented,
the next outrage was on Germany, in assuming that an
insignificant prince of that country could not be permitted
to accept the invitation,&mdash;all of which, besides
being of insufferable insolence, was in that worst dynastic
spirit which looks to princes rather than the people.
Plainly France was unjustifiable. When I say it was
none of her business, I give it the mildest condemnation.
This was the first step in her monstrous <em>blunder-crime</em>.</p>

<p>Its character as a pretext becomes painfully manifest,
when we learn more of the famous Prince Leopold, thus
invited by Spain and opposed by France. It is true
that his family name is in part the same as that of the
Prussian king. Each is Hohenzollern; but he adds Sigmaringen
to the name. The two are different branches
of the same family; but you must ascend to the twelfth
century, counting more than twenty degrees, before y<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>ou
come to a common ancestor.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> And yet on this most
distant and infinitesimal relationship the French pretension
is founded. But audacity changes to the ridiculous,
when it is known that the Prince is nearer in relationship
to the French Emperor than to the Prussian King,
and this by three different intermarriages, which do not
go back to the twelfth century. Here is the case. His
grandfather had for wife a niece of Joachim Murat,<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a>
king of Naples, and brother-in-law of the first Napoleon;
and his father had for wife a daughter of Stéphanie
de Beauharnais, an adopted daughter of the first
Napoleon; so that Prince Leopold is by his father great-grand-nephew
of Murat, and by his mother he is grandson
of Stéphanie de Beauharnais, who was cousin and
by adoption sister of Hortense de Beauharnais, mother
of the present Emperor; and to this may be added still
another connection, by the marriage of his father’s sister
with Joachim Napoleon, Marquis of Pepoli, grandson of
Joachim Murat.<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> It was natural that a person thus
connected with the Imperial Family should be a welcome
visitor at the Tuileries; and it is easy to believe
that Marshal Prim, who offered him the throne, was
encouraged to believe that the Emperor’s kinsman and
guest would be favorably regarded by France. And
yet, in the face of these things, and the three several
family ties, fresh and modern, binding him to France
and the French Emperor, the pretension was set up that
his occupation of the Spanish throne would put in peril
the interests and the honor of France.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<h4>BECAUSE FRANCE WAS READY.</h4>

<p>In sending defiance to Prussia on this question, the
French Cabinet selected their own ground. Evidently a
war had been meditated, and the candidature of Prince
Leopold from beginning to end supplied a pretext. In
this conclusion, which is too obvious, we are hardly left
to inference. The secret was disclosed by Rouher, President
of the Senate, lately the eloquent and unscrupulous
Minister, when, in an official address to the Emperor,
immediately after the War Manifesto read by the Prime-Minister,
he declared that France quivered with indignation
at the flights of an ambition over-excited by the
one day’s good-fortune at Sadowa, and then proceeded:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Animated by that calm perseverance which is true force,
your Majesty has known how to wait; but in the last four
years you have carried to its highest perfection the arming of
our soldiers, and raised to its full power the organization of
our military forces. <em>Thanks to your care, Sire, France is
ready.</em>”<a name="FNanchor_190_190" id="FNanchor_190_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_190" class="fnanchor">[190]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus, according to the President of the Senate, France,
after waiting, commenced war because she was ready,&mdash;while,
according to the Cabinet, it was on the point of
honor. Both were right. The war was declared because
the Emperor thought himself ready, and a pretext
was found in the affair of the telegram.</p>

<p>Considering the age, and the present demands of
civilization, such a war stands forth terrific in wrong,
making the soul rise indignant against it. One reason
avowed is brutal; the other is frivolous; both are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
criminal. If we look into the text of the Manifesto
and the speeches of the Cabinet, it is a war founded on
a trifle, on a straw, on an egg-shell. Obviously these
were pretexts only. Therefore it is a war of pretexts,
the real object being the humiliation and dismemberment
of Germany, in the vain hope of exalting the
French Empire and perpetuating a bawble crown on
the head of a boy. By military success and a peace
dictated at Berlin, the Emperor trusted to find himself
in such condition, that, on return to Paris, he could
overthrow parliamentary government so far as it existed
there, and reëstablish personal government, where
all depended upon himself,&mdash;thus making triumph over
Germany the means of another triumph over the French
people.</p>

<p>In other times there have been wars as criminal
in origin, where trifle, straw, or egg-shell played its
part; but they contrasted less with the surrounding
civilization. To this list belong the frequent Dynastic
Wars, prompted by the interest, the passion, or the
whim of some one in the Family of Kings. Others
have begun in recklessness kindred to that we now
witness,&mdash;as when England entered into war with Holland,
and for reason did not hesitate to allege “abusive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
pictures.”<a name="FNanchor_191_191" id="FNanchor_191_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_191" class="fnanchor">[191]</a> The England of Charles the Second was
hardly less sensitive than the France of Louis Napoleon,
while in each was similar indifference to consequences.
But France has precedents of her own.
From the remarkable correspondence of the Princess
Palatine, Duchess of Orléans, we learn that the first
war with Holland under Louis the Fourteenth was
brought on by the Minister, De Lionne, to injure a petty
German prince who had made him jealous of his
wife.<a name="FNanchor_192_192" id="FNanchor_192_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_192" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> The communicative and exuberant Saint-Simon
tells us twice over how Louvois, another Minister of
Louis the Fourteenth, being overruled by his master
with regard to the dimensions of a window at Versailles,
was filled with the idea that “on account of a
few inches in a window,” as he expressed it, all his
services would be forgotten, and therefore, to save his
place, excited a foreign war that would make him necessary
to the King. The flames in the Palatinate,
devouring the works of man, attested his continuing
power. The war became general, but, according to the
chronicler, it ruined France at home, and did not extend
her domain abroad.<a name="FNanchor_193_193" id="FNanchor_193_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> The French Emperor confidently
expected to occupy the same historic region so often
burnt and ravaged by French armies, with that castle
of Heidelberg which repeats the tale of blood,&mdash;and,
let me say, expected it for no better reason than that
of his royal predecessor, stimulated by an unprincipled
Minister anxious for personal position. The parallel is
continued in the curse which the Imperial arms have
brought on France.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<h4>PROGRESS OF THE WAR.</h4>

<p>How this war proceeded I need not recount. You
have all read the record day by day, sorrowing for Humanity,&mdash;how,
after briefest interval of preparation or
hesitation, the two combatants first crossed swords at
Saarbrücken, within the German frontier, and the
young Prince Imperial performed his part in picking
up a bullet from the field, which the Emperor promptly
reported by telegraph to the Empress,&mdash;how this little
military success is all that was vouchsafed to the man
who began the war,&mdash;how soon thereafter victory followed,
first on the hill-sides of Wissembourg and then
of Woerth, shattering the army of MacMahon, to which
the Empire was looking so confidently,&mdash;how another
large army under Bazaine was driven within the strong
fortress of Metz,&mdash;how all the fortresses, bristling with
guns and frowning upon Germany, were invested,&mdash;how
battle followed battle on various fields, where
Death was the great conqueror,&mdash;how, with help of
modern art, war showed itself to be murder by machinery,&mdash;how
MacMahon, gathering together his scattered
men and strengthening them with reinforcements,
attempted to relieve Bazaine,&mdash;how at last, after long
marches, his large army found itself shut up at Sedan
with a tempest of fire beating upon its huddled ranks,
so that its only safety was capitulation,&mdash;how with the
capitulation of the army was the submission of the
Emperor himself, who gave his sword to the King of
Prussia and became prisoner of war,&mdash;and how, on the
reception of this news at Paris, Louis Napoleon and his
dynasty were divested of their powers and the Empi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>re
was lost in the Republic. These things you know. I
need not dwell on them. Not to battles and their fearful
vicissitudes, where all is incarnadined with blood,
must we look, but to the ideas which prevail,&mdash;as for
the measure of time we look, not to the pendulum in
its oscillations, but to the clock in the tower, whose
striking tells the hours. A great hour for Humanity
sounded when the Republic was proclaimed. And this
I say, even should it fail again; for every attempt contributes
to the final triumph.</p>


<h4>A WAR OF SURPRISES.</h4>

<p>The war, from the pretext at its beginning to the
capitulation at Sedan, has been a succession of surprises,
where the author of the pretext was a constant
sufferer. Nor is this strange. Falstaff says, with humorous
point, “See now how wit may be made a Jack-a-lent,
when ’tis upon ill employment!”<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a>&mdash;and another
character, in a play of Beaumont and Fletcher,
reveals the same evil destiny in stronger terms, when
he says,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Hell gives us art to reach the depth of sin,</div>
<div class="verse">But leaves us wretched fools, when we are in.”<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And this was precisely the condition of the French
Empire. Germany perhaps had one surprise, at the
sudden adoption of the pretext for war. But the Empire
has known nothing but surprise. A fatal surprise
was the promptitude with which all the German States,
outside of Austrian rule, accepted the leadership of
Prussia, and joined their forces to hers. Differe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>nces
were forgotten,&mdash;whether the hate of Hanover, the
dread of Würtemberg, the coolness of Bavaria, the opposition
of Saxony, or the impatience of the Hanse Towns
at lost importance. Hanover would not rise; the other
States and cities would not be detached. On the day
after the reading of the War Manifesto at the French
tribune, even before the King’s speech to the Northern
Parliament, the Southern States began to move. German
unity stood firm, and this was the supreme surprise
for France with which the war began. On one
day the Emperor in his Official Journal declares his object
to be the deliverance of Bavaria from Prussian oppression,
and on the very next day the Crown Prince of
Prussia, at the head of Bavarian troops, crushes an Imperial
army.</p>

<p>Then came the manifest inferiority of the Imperial
army, everywhere outnumbered, which was another surprise,&mdash;the
manifest inferiority of the Imperial artillery,
also a surprise,&mdash;the manifest inferiority of the
Imperial generals, still a surprise. Above these was a
prevailing inefficiency and improvidence, which very
soon became conspicuous, and this was a surprise. The
strength of Germany, as now exhibited, was a surprise.
And when the German armies entered France, every
step was a surprise. Wissembourg was a surprise; so
was Woerth; so was Beaumont; so was Sedan. Every
encounter was a surprise. Abel Douay, the French
general, who fell bravely fighting at Wissembourg, the
first sacrifice on the battle-field, was surprised; so was
MacMahon, not only at the beginning, but at the end.
He thought that the King and Crown Prince were
marching on Paris. So they were,&mdash;but they turned
aside for a few days to surprise a whole army of more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
than a hundred thousand men, terrible with cannon and
newly invented implements of war, under a Marshal
of France, and with an Emperor besides. As this succession
of surprises was crowned with what seemed the
greatest surprise of all, there remained a greater still in
the surprise of the French Empire. No Greek Nemesis
with unrelenting hand ever dealt more incessantly the
unavoidable blow, until the Empire fell as a dead body
falls, while the Emperor became a captive and the Empress
a fugitive, with their only child a fugitive also.
The poet says:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy</div>
<div class="verse">In sceptred pall come sweeping by.”<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">It has swept before the eyes of all. Beneath that sceptred
pall is the dust of a great Empire, founded and
ruled by Louis Napoleon; if not the dust of the Emperor
also, it is because he was willing to sacrifice others
rather than himself.</p>


<h4>OTHER FRENCH SOVEREIGNS CAPTURED ON THE
BATTLE-FIELD.</h4>

<p>Twice before have French sovereigns yielded on the
battle-field, and become prisoners of war; but never
before was capitulation so vast. Do their fates furnish
any lesson? At the Battle of Poitiers, memorable
in English history, John, King of France, became the
prisoner of Edward the Black Prince. His nobles, one
after another, fell by his side, but he contended valiantly
to the last, until, spent with fatigue and overcome
by numbers, he surrendered. His son, of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
same age as the son of the French Emperor, was
wounded while battling for his father. The courtesy
of the English Prince conquered more than his arms.
I quote the language of Hume:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“More touched by Edward’s generosity than by his own
calamities, he confessed, that, notwithstanding his defeat and
captivity, his honor was still unimpaired, and that, if he
yielded the victory, it was at least gained by a prince of such
consummate valor and humanity.”<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The King was taken to England, where, after swelling
the triumphal pageant of his conqueror, he made a disgraceful
treaty for the dismemberment of France, which
the indignant nation would not ratify. A captivity of
more than four years was terminated by a ransom of
three million crowns in gold,&mdash;an enormous sum, more
than ten million dollars in our day. Evidently the King
was unfortunate, for he did not continue in France, but,
under the influence of motives differently stated, returned
to England, where he died. Surely here is a
lesson.</p>

<p>More famous than John was Francis, with salamander
crest, also King of France, and rich in gayety,
whose countenance, depicted by that art of which he
was the patron, stands forth conspicuous in the line of
kings. As the French Emperor attacked Germany, so
did the King enter Italy, and he was equally confident
of victory. On the field of Pavia he encountered an
army of Charles the Fifth, but commanded by his generals,
when, after fighting desperately and killing seven
men with his own hand, he was compelled to surrende<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>r.
His mother was at the time Regent of France, and to
her he is said to have written the sententious letter,
“All is lost except honor.” No such letter was written
by Francis,<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> nor do we know of any such letter by Louis
Napoleon; but the situation of the two Regents was
identical. Here are the words in which Hume describes
the condition of the earlier:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The Princess was struck with the greatness of the calamity.
She saw the kingdom without a sovereign, without an
army, without generals, without money, surrounded on every
side by implacable and victorious enemies; and her chief resource,
in her present distresses, were the hopes which she
entertained of peace, and even of assistance from the King
of England.”<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Francis became the prisoner of Charles the Fifth,
and was conveyed to Madrid, where, after a year of
captivity, he was at length released, crying out, as he
crossed the French frontier, “Behold me King again!”<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a>
Is not the fate of Louis Napoleon prefigured in the exile
and death of his royal predecessor John, rather than
in the return of Francis with his delighted cry?</p>


<h4>LOUIS NAPOLEON.</h4>

<p>The fall of Louis Napoleon is natural. It is hard to
see how it could be otherwise, so long as we continue to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent2">“assert eternal Providence,</div>
<div class="verse">And justify the ways of God to men.”<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a></div>
</div>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span></p>
<p class="noindent">Had he remained successful to the end, and died peacefully
on the throne, his name would have been a perpetual
encouragement to dishonesty and crime. By
treachery without parallel, breaking repeated promises
and his oath of office, he was able to trample on the
Republic. Taking his place in the National Assembly
after long exile, the adventurer made haste to declare
exultation in regaining his country and all his rights as
citizen, with the ejaculation, “The Republic has given
me this happiness: let the Republic receive my oath
of gratitude, my oath of devotion!”&mdash;and next he proclaimed
that there was nobody to surpass him in determined
consecration “to the defence of order and to the
establishment of the Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Good words these.
Then again, when candidate for the Presidency, in a
manifesto to the electors he gave another pledge, announcing
that he “would devote himself altogether,
without mental reservation, to the establishment of a
Republic, wise in its laws, honest in its intentions, great
and strong in its acts”; and he volunteered further
words, binding him in special loyalty, saying that he
“should make it <em>a point of honor</em> to leave to his successor,
at the end of four years, power strengthened, liberty
intact, real progress accomplished.”<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> How these plain
and unequivocal engagements were openly broken you
shall see.</p>

<p>Chosen by the popular voice, his inauguration took
place as President of the Republic, when he solemnly
renewed the engagements already assumed. Ascending
from his seat in the Assembly to the tribune, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>holding
up his hand, he took the following oath of office:
“In presence of God, and before the French people,
represented by the National Assembly, I swear to remain
faithful to the Democratic Republic One and
Indivisible, and to fulfil all the duties which the Constitution
imposes upon me.” This was an oath. Then,
addressing the Assembly, he said: “The suffrages of the
nation and the oath which I have just taken prescribe
my future conduct. My duty is marked out. I will
fulfil it as <em>a man of honor</em>.” Again he attests his
honor. Then, after deserved tribute to his immediate
predecessor and rival, General Cavaignac, on his loyalty
of character, and that sentiment of duty which he declares
to be “the first quality in the chief of a State,”
he renews his vows to the Republic, saying, “We have,
Citizen Representatives, a great mission to fulfil; it is
to found a Republic in the interest of all”; and he
closed amidst cheers for the Republic.<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> And yet, in the
face of this oath of office and this succession of most
solemn pledges, where he twice attests his honor, he
has hardly become President before he commences plotting
to make himself Emperor, until, at last, by violence
and blood, with brutal butchery in the streets of Paris,
he succeeded in overthrowing the Republic, to which he
was bound by obligations of gratitude and duty, as well
as by engagements in such various form. The Empire
was declared. Then followed his marriage, and a dynastic
ambition to assure the crown for his son.</p>

<p>Early in life a “Charcoal” conspirator against kings,<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a>
he now became a crowned conspirator against republics.
The name of Republic was to him a reproof, while
its glory was a menace. Against the Roman Republ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>ic
he conspired early; and when the rebellion waged
by Slavery seemed to afford opportunity, he conspired
against our Republic, promoting as far as he dared the
independence of the Slave States, and at the same time
on the ruins of the Mexican Republic setting up a mock
Empire. In similar spirit has he conspired against German
Unity, whose just strength promised to be a wall
against his unprincipled self-seeking.</p>

<p>This is but an outline of that incomparable perfidy,
which, after a career of seeming success, is brought to a
close. Of a fallen man I would say nothing; but, for
the sake of Humanity, Louis Napoleon should be exposed.
He was of evil example, extending with his
influence. To measure the vastness of this detriment
is impossible. In sacrificing the Republic to his own
aggrandizement, in ruling for a dynasty rather than
the people, in subordinating the peace of the world to
his own wicked ambition for his boy, he set an example
of selfishness, and in proportion to his triumph was
mankind corrupted in its judgment of human conduct.
Teaching men to seek ascendency at the expense of
duty, he demoralized not only France, but the world.
Unquestionably part of this evil example was his falsehood
to the Republic. Promise, pledge, honor, oath,
were all violated in this monstrous treason. Never in
history was greater turpitude. Unquestionably he could
have saved the Republic, but he preferred his own exaltation.
As I am a Republican, and believe republican
institutions for the good of mankind, I cannot pardon
the traitor. The people of France are ignorant; he did
not care to have them educated, for their ignorance was
his strength. With education bestowed, the Republic
would have been assured. And even after the Empire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
had he thought more of education and less of his dynasty,
there would have been a civilization throughout
France making war impossible. Unquestionably the
present war is his work, instituted for his imagined advantage.
Bacon, in one of his remarkable Essays, tells
us that “Extreme self-lovers will set an house on fire,
and it were but to roast their eggs.”<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Louis Napoleon
has set Europe on fire to roast his.</p>

<p>Beyond the continuing offence of his public life, I
charge upon him three special and unpardonable crimes:
first, that violation of public duty and public faith, contrary
to all solemnities of promise, by which the whole
order of society was weakened and human character was
degraded; secondly, disloyalty to republican institutions,
so that through him the Republic has been arrested in
Europe; and, thirdly, this cruel and causeless war, of
which he is the guilty author.</p>


<h4>RETRIBUTION.</h4>

<p>Of familiar texts in Scripture, there is one which,
since the murderous outbreak, has been of constant applicability
and force. You know it: “All they that
take the sword shall perish with the sword”:<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> and these
words are addressed to nations as to individuals. France
took the sword against Germany, and now lies bleeding
at every pore. Louis Napoleon took the sword, and is
nought. Already in that <i>coup d’état</i> by which he overthrew
the Republic he took the sword, and now the
Empire, which was the work of his hands, expires. In
Mexico again he took the sword, and again paid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
fearful penalty,&mdash;while the Austrian Archduke, who,
yielding to his pressure, made himself Emperor there,
was shot by order of the Mexican President, an Indian
of unmixed blood. And here there was retribution, not
only for the French Emperor, but far beyond. I know
not if there be invisible threads by which the Present
is attached to the distant Past, making the descendant
suffer even for a distant ancestor, but I cannot forget
that Maximilian was derived from that very family of
Charles the Fifth, whose conquering general, Cortés,
stretched the Indian Guatemozin upon a bed of fire,
and afterwards executed him on a tree. The death of
Maximilian was tardy retribution for the death of Guatemozin.
And thus in this world is wrong avenged,
sometimes after many generations. The fall of the
French Emperor is an illustration of that same retribution
which is so constant. While he yet lives, judgment
has begun.</p>

<p>If I accumulate instances, it is because the certainty
of retribution for wrong, and especially for the great
wrong of War, is a lesson of the present duel to be impressed.
Take notice, all who would appeal to war,
that the way of the transgressor is hard, and sooner or
later he is overtaken. The ban may fall tardily, but it
is sure to fall.</p>

<p>Retribution in another form has already visited France;
nor is its terrible vengeance yet spent. Not only are
populous cities, all throbbing with life and filled with
innocent households, subjected to siege, but to bombardment
also,&mdash;being that most ruthless trial of war, where
non-combatants, including women and children, sick
and aged, share with the soldier his peculiar perils, and
suffer alike with him. All are equal before the hideous<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
shell, crashing, bursting, destroying, killing, and changing
the fairest scene into blood-spattered wreck. Against
its vengeful, slaughterous descent there is no protection
for the people,&mdash;nothing but an uncertain shelter in
cellars, or, it may be, in the common sewers. Already
Strasbourg, Toul, and Metz have been called to endure
this indiscriminate massacre, where there is no distinction
of persons; and now the same fate is threatened
to Paris the Beautiful, with its thronging population
counted by the million. Thus is the ancient chalice
which France handed to others now commended to her
own lips. It was France that first in history adopted
this method of war. Long ago, under Louis the Fourteenth,
it became a favorite; but it has not escaped the
judgment of history. Voltaire, with elegant pen, records
that “this art, carried soon among other nations,
served only to multiply human calamities, and more
than once was dreadful to France, where it was invented.”<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a>
The bombardment of Luxembourg in 1683
drew from Sismondi, always humane and refined, words
applicable to recent events. “Louis the Fourteenth,”
he says, “had been the first to put in practice this
atrocious and newly invented method of bombarding
towns, … of attacking, not fortifications, but private
houses, not soldiers, but peaceable inhabitants, women
and children, and of confounding thousands of private
crimes, each one of which would cause horror, in one
great public crime, one great disaster, which he regarded
as nothing more than one of the catastrophes of war.”<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a>
Again is the saying fulfilled, “All they that take t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>he
sword shall perish with the sword.” No lapse of time
can avert the inexorable law. Macbeth saw it in his
terrible imaginings, when he said,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse indent6">“But in these cases</div>
<div class="verse">We still have judgment here,&mdash;that we but teach</div>
<div class="verse">Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return</div>
<div class="verse">To plague the inventor.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">And what instruction more bloody than the bombardment
of a city, which now returns to plague the French
people?</p>

<p>Thus is history something more even than philosophy
teaching by example; it is sermon with argument and
exhortation. The simple record of nations preaches;
and whether you regard reason or the affections, it is
the same. If nations were wise or humane, they would
not fight.</p>


<h4>PEACE AFTER CAPITULATION AT SEDAN.</h4>

<p>Vain are lessons of the past or texts of prudence
against that spirit of War which finds sanction and
regulation in International Law. So long as the war
system continues, men will fight. While I speak, the
two champions still stand front to front, Germany exulting
in victory, but France in no respect submissive.
The duel still rages, although one of the champions is
pressed to earth, as in that early combat where the
Chevalier Bayard, so eminent in chivalry, thrust his
dagger into the nostrils of his fallen foe, and then
dragged his dead body off the field. History now repeats
itself, and we witness in Germany the very conduct
condemned in the famous French knight.</p>

<p>The French Emperor was the aggressor. He began
this fatal duel. Let him fall,&mdash;but not the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
of France. Cruelly already have they expiated their
offence in accepting such a ruler. Not always should
they suffer. Enough of waste, enough of sacrifice,
enough of slaughter have they undergone. Enough
have they felt the accursed hoof of War.</p>

<p>It is easy to see now, that, after the capitulation at
Sedan, there was a double mistake: first, on the part
of Germany, which, as magnanimous conqueror, should
have proposed peace, thus conquering in character as in
arms; and, secondly, on the part of the Republic, which
should have declined to wage a war of Imperialism,
against which the Republican leaders had so earnestly
protested. With the capitulation of the Emperor the
dynastic question was closed. There was no longer
pretension or pretext, nor was there occasion for war.
The two parties should have come to an understanding.
Why continue this terrible homicidal, fratricidal, suicidal
combat, fraught with mutual death and sacrifice?
Why march on Paris? Why beleaguer Paris? Why
bombard Paris? To what end? If for the humiliation
of France, then must it be condemned.</p>


<h4>THREE ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS OF PEACE.</h4>

<p>In arriving at terms of peace, there are at least three
conditions which cannot be overlooked in the interest of
civilization, and that the peace may be such in reality
as in name, and not an armistice only,&mdash;three postulates
which stand above all question, and dominate this
debate, so that any essential departure from them must
end in wretched failure.</p>

<p>The first is the natural requirement of Germany, that
there shall be completest guaranty against fut<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>ure aggression,
constituting what is so well known among us as
“Security for the Future.” Count Bismarck, with an
exaggeration hardly pardonable, alleges more than
twenty invasions of Germany by France, and declares
that these must be stopped forever.<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Many or few,
they must be stopped forever. The second condition to
be regarded is the natural requirement of France, that
the guaranty, while sufficient, shall be such as not
to wound needlessly the sentiments of the French
people, or to offend any principle of public law. It is
difficult to question these two postulates, at least in the
abstract. Only when we come to the application is
there opportunity for difference. The third postulate,
demanded alike by justice and humanity, is the establishment
of some rule or precedent by which the recurrence
of such a barbarous duel shall be prevented. It
will not be enough to obtain a guaranty for Germany;
there must be a guaranty for Civilization itself.</p>

<p>On careful inquiry, it will be seen that all these can
be accomplished in one way only, which I will describe,
when I have first shown what is now put forward and
discussed as the claim of Germany, under two different
heads, Indemnity and Guaranty.</p>


<h4>INDEMNITY OF GERMANY.</h4>

<p>I have already spoken of Guaranty as an essential
condition. Indemnity is not essential. At the close
of our war with Slavery we said nothing of indemnity.
For the life of the citizen there could be no indemnity;
nor was it practicable even for the treasure sacrificed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Security for the Future was all that our nation required,
and this was found in provisions of Law and Constitution
establishing Equal Rights. From various intimations
it is evident that Germany will not be content
without indemnity in money on a large scale; and it
is also evident that France, the aggressor, cannot, when
conquered, deny liability to a certain extent. The question
will be on the amount. Already German calculators
begin to array their unrelenting figures. One of
these insists that the indemnity shall not only cover
outlay for the German Army,&mdash;pensions of widows
and invalids,&mdash;maintenance and support of French
wounded and prisoners,&mdash;compensation to Germans
expelled from France,&mdash;also damage suffered by the
territory to be annexed, especially Strasbourg; but it is
also to cover indirect damages, large in amount,&mdash;as,
loss to the nation from change of productive laborers
into soldiers,&mdash;loss from killing and disabling so many
laborers,&mdash;and, generally, loss from suspension of trade
and manufactures, depreciation of national property,
and diminution of the public revenues:&mdash;all of which,
according to a recent estimate, reach the fearful sum-total
of 4,935,000,000 francs, or nearly one thousand
million dollars. Of this sum, 1,255,000,000 francs are
on account of the Army, 1,230,000,000 for direct damage,
2,250,000,000 for indirect damage, and 200,000,000
for damage to the reconquered provinces. Still further,
the Berlin Chamber of Commerce insists on indemnity
not only for actual loss of ships and cargoes from the
blockade, but also for damages on account of detention.
Much of this many-headed account, which I introduce
in order to open the case in its extent, will be opposed
by France, as fabulous, consequential, and remote. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
practical question will be, Can one nation do wrong to
another without paying for the damage, whatever it
may be, direct or indirect,&mdash;always provided it be
susceptible of estimate? Here I content myself with
the remark, that, while in the settlement of international
differences there is no place for technicality,
there is always room for moderation.</p>


<h4>GUARANTY OF DISMEMBERMENT.</h4>

<p>Vast as may be the claim of indemnity, it opens
no question so calculated to touch the sensibilities of
France as the claim of guaranty already announced by
Germany. On this head we are not left to conjecture.
From her first victory we have been assured that Germany
would claim Alsace and German Lorraine, with
their famous strongholds; and now we have the statement
of Count Bismarck, in a diplomatic circular, that
he expects to remove the German frontier further
west,&mdash;meaning to the Vosges Mountains, if not to
the Moselle also,&mdash;and to convert the fortresses into
what he calls “defensive strongholds of Germany.”<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a>
Then, with larger view, he declares, that, “in rendering
it more difficult for France, from whom all European
troubles have so long proceeded, to assume the offensive,
we likewise promote the common interest of Europe,
which demands the preservation of peace.” Here
is just recognition of peace as the common interest of
Europe, to be assured by disabling France. How shall
this be done? The German Minister sees nothing but
dismemberment, consecrated by a Treaty of Peace.
With diplomatic shears he would cut off a portion of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
French territory, and, taking from it the name of France,
stamp upon it the trade-mark of Germany. Two of its
richest and most precious provinces, for some two hundred
years constituent parts of the great nation, with
that ancient cathedral city, the pride of the Rhine, long
years ago fortified by Vauban as “the strongest barrier
of France,”<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> are to be severed, and with them a large
and industrious population, which, while preserving the
German language, have so far blended with France as
to become Frenchmen. This is the German proposition,
which I call the Guaranty of Dismemberment.</p>

<p>One argument for this proposition is brushed aside
easily. Had the fortune of war been adverse to Germany,
it is said, peace would have been dictated at Berlin,
perhaps at Königsberg, and France would have
carried her frontier eastward to the Rhine, dismembering
Germany. Such, I doubt not, would have been the
attempt. The conception is entirely worthy of that
Imperial levity with which the war began. But the
madcap menace of the French Empire cannot be the
measure of German justice. It is for Germany to show,
that, notwithstanding this wildness, she knows how to
be just. Dismemberment on this account would be
only another form of retaliation; but retaliation is
barbarous.</p>

<p>To the argument, that these provinces, with their
strongholds, are needed for the defence of Germany,
there is the obvious reply, that, if cut off from France
contrary to the wishes of the local population, and
with the French people in chronic irritation on this
account, they will be places of weakness rather than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
strength, strongholds of disaffection rather than defence,
to be held always at the cannon’s mouth. Does Germany
seek lasting peace? Not in this way can it be
had. A painful exaction, enforced by triumphant arms,
must create a sentiment of hostility in France, suppressed
for a season, but ready at a propitious moment
to break forth in violence; so that between the two
conterminous nations there will be nothing better than
a peace where each sleeps on its arms,&mdash;which is but
an Armed Peace. Such for weary years has been the
condition of nations. Is Germany determined to prolong
the awful curse? Will her most enlightened
people, with poetry, music, literature, philosophy, science,
and religion as constant ministers, to whom has
been opened in rarest degree the whole book of knowledge,
persevere in a brutal policy belonging to another
age, and utterly alien to that superior civilization which
is so truly theirs?</p>

<p>There is another consideration, not only of justice,
but of public law, which cannot be overcome. The
people of these provinces are unwilling to be separated
from France. This is enough. France cannot sell or
transfer them against their consent. Consult the great
masters, and you will find their concurring authority.
Grotius, from whom on such a question there can be no
appeal, adjudges: “In the alienation of a part of the
sovereignty it is required <em>that the part which is to be
alienated consent to the act</em>.” According to him, it must
not be supposed “that the body should have the right
of cutting off parts from itself and giving them into the
authority <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>of another.”<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Of the same opinion is Pufendorf,
declaring: “The sovereign who attempts to transfer
his kingdom to another by his sole authority does
an act in itself null and void, and not binding on his
subjects. To make such a conveyance valid, the consent
of the people is required, as well as of the prince.”<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a>
Vattel crowns this testimony, when he adds, that a
province or city, “abandoned and dismembered from
the State, is not obliged to receive the new master
proposed to be given it.”<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> Before such texts, stronger
than a fortress, the soldiers of Germany must halt.</p>

<p>Nor can it be forgotten how inconsistent is the guaranty
of Dismemberment with that heroic passion for national
unity which is the glory of Germany. National
unity is not less the right of France than of Germany;
and these provinces, though in former centuries German,
and still preserving the German speech, belong to the
existing unity of France,&mdash;unless, according to the popular
song, the German’s Fatherland extends</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Far as the German accent rings”;</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">and then the conqueror must insist on Switzerland; and
why not cross the Atlantic, to dictate laws in Pennsylvania
and Chicago? But this same song has a better
verse, calling that the German’s Fatherland</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Where in the heart love warmly lies.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">But in these coveted provinces it is the love for France,
and not for Germany, which prevails.</p>


<h4>GUARANTY OF DISARMAMENT.</h4>

<p>The Guaranty of Dismemberment, when brought to
the touchstone of the three essential conditions, i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>s found
wanting. Dismissing it as unsatisfactory, I come to
that other guaranty where these conditions are all fulfilled,
and we find security for Germany without offence
to the just sentiments of France, and also a new safeguard
to civilization. Against the Guaranty of Dismemberment
I oppose the Guaranty of Disarmament. By
Disarmament I mean the razing of the French fortifications
and the abolition of the standing army, except
that minimum of force required for purposes of police.
How completely this satisfies the conditions already
named is obvious. For Germany there would be on the
side of France absolute repose, so that Count Bismarck
need not fear another invasion,&mdash;while France, saved
from intolerable humiliation, would herself be free to
profit by the new civilization.</p>

<p>Nor is this guaranty otherwise than practical in every
respect, and the more it is examined the more will its
inestimable advantage be apparent.</p>

<p>1. There is, first, its most obvious <em>economy</em>, which is
so glaring, that, according to a familiar French expression,
“it leaps into the eyes.” Undertaking even briefly
to set it forth, I seem to follow the proverb and “show
the sun with a lantern.” According to the “Almanach
de Gotha,” the appropriations for the army of France,
during the year of peace before the war, were 588,852,970
francs,<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a>&mdash;or about one hundred and seventeen
millions of dollars. Give up the Standing Army and
this considerable sum disappears from the annual budget.
But this retrenchment represents only partially
the prodigious economy. Beyond the annual outlay is
the loss to the nation by the change of producers into
non-producers. Admitting that in France the average<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
annual production of a soldier usefully employed would
be only fifty dollars, and multiplying this small allowance
by the numbers of the Standing Army, you have
another amount to be piled upon the military appropriations.
Is it too much to expect that this surpassing
waste shall be stopped? Must the extravagance born
of war, and nursed by long tradition, continue to drain
the resources of the land? Where is reason? Where
humanity? A decree abolishing the Standing Army
would be better for the French people, and more productive,
than the richest gold-mine discovered in every
department of France. Nor can imagination picture
the fruitful result. I speak now only in the light of
economy. Relieved from intolerable burden, industry
would lift itself to unimagined labors, and society be
quickened anew.</p>

<p>2. Beyond this economy, which need not be argued,
is the positive <em>advantage, if not necessity</em>, of such change
for France. I do not speak on general grounds applicable
to all nations, but on grounds peculiar to France at
the present moment. Emerging from a most destructive
war, she will be subjected to enormous and unprecedented
contributions of every kind. After satisfying
Germany, she will find other obligations at home,&mdash;some
pressing directly upon the nation, and others upon
individuals. Beyond the outstanding pay of soldiers,
requisitions for supplies, pensions for the wounded and
the families of the dead, and other extraordinary liabilities
accumulating as never before in the same time,
there will be the duty of renewing that internal prosperity
which has received such a shock; and here the
work of restoration will be costly, whether to the nation
or the individual. Revenue must be regained, roads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
and bridges repaired, markets supplied; nor can we
omit the large and multitudinous losses from ravage of
fields, seizure of stock, suspension of business, stoppage
of manufactures, interference with agriculture, and the
whole terrible drain of war by which the people are
impoverished and disabled. If to the necessary appropriation
and expenditure for all these things is superadded
the annual tax of a Standing Army, and that
other draft from the change of producers into non-producers,
plainly here is a supplementary burden of
crushing weight. Talk of the last feather breaking
the back of the camel,&mdash;but never was camel loaded
down as France.</p>

<p>3. Beyond even these considerations of economy and
advantage I put the transcendent, priceless benefit of
Disarmament in the <em>assurance of peace</em>. Disarmament
substitutes the constable for the soldier, and reduces the
Standing Army to a police. The argument assumes,
first, the needlessness of a Standing Army, and, secondly,
its evil influence. Both of these points were
touched at an early day by the wise Chancellor of England,
Sir Thomas More, when, in his practical and personal
Introduction to “Utopia,” he alludes to what he
calls the “bad custom” of keeping many servants, and
then says: “In France there is yet a more pestiferous
sort of people; for the whole country is full of soldiers,
that are still kept up in time of peace,&mdash;if such a state
of a nation can be called a peace.” Then, proceeding
with his judgment, the Chancellor holds up what he
calls those “pretended statesmen” whose maxim is that
“it is necessary for the public safety to have a good
body of veteran soldiers ever in read<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>iness.” And after
saying that these pretended statesmen “sometimes seek
occasion for making war, that they may train up their
soldiers in the art of cutting throats,” he adds, in words
soon to be tested, “But France has learned, to its cost,
how dangerous it is to feed such beasts.”<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> It will be
well, if France has learned this important lesson. The
time has come to practise it.</p>

<p>All history is a vain word, and all experience is at
fault, if large War Preparations, of which the Standing
Army is the type, have not been constant provocatives
of war. Pretended protectors against war, they have
been real instigators to war. They have excited the
evil against which they were to guard. The habit of
wearing arms in private life exercised a kindred influence.
So long as this habit continued, society was
darkened by personal combat, street-fight, duel, and assassination.
The Standing Army is to the nation what
the sword was to the modern gentleman, the stiletto to
the Italian, the knife to the Spaniard, the pistol to our
slave-master,&mdash;furnishing, like these, the means of
death; and its possessor is not slow to use it. In stating
the operation of this system we are not left to inference.
As France, according to Sir Thomas More,
shows “how dangerous it is to feed such beasts,” so
does Prussia, in ever-memorable instance, which speaks
now with more than ordinary authority, show precisely
how the Standing Army may become the incentive to
war. Frederick, the warrior king, is our witness. With
honesty or impudence beyond parallel, he did not hesitate
to record in his Memoirs, among the reasons for his
war upon Maria Theresa, that, on coming to the throne,
he found himself with “troops always ready to act.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>”
Voltaire, when called to revise the royal memoirs,
erased this confession, but preserved a copy;<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> so that
by his literary activity we have this kingly authority
for the mischief from a Standing Army. How complete
a weapon was that army may be learned from
Lafayette, who, in a letter to Washington, in 1786, after
a visit to the King, described it thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Nothing can be compared to the beauty of the troops, to
the discipline which reigns in all their ranks, to the simplicity
of their movements, to the uniformity of their regiments.…
All the situations which can be supposed in
war, all the movements which these must necessitate, have
been by constant habit so inculcated in their heads, that all
these operations are done almost mechanically.”<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Nothing better has been devised since the Macedonian
phalanx or the Roman legion. With such a weapon
ready to his hands, the King struck Maria Theresa.
And think you that the present duel between France
and Germany could have been waged, had not both nations
found themselves, like Frederick of Prussia, with
“troops always ready to act”? It was the possession of
these troops which made the two parties rush so swiftly
to the combat. Is not the lesson perfect? Already
individuals have disarmed. Civilization requires that
nations shall do likewise.</p>

<p>Thus is Disarmament enforced on three several
grounds: first, economy; secondly, positive advantage,
if not necessity, for France; and, thirdly, assurance of
peace. No other guaranty promises so much. Does<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
any other guaranty promise anything beyond the accident
of force? Nor would France be alone. Dismissing
to the arts of peace the large army victorious over
Slavery, our Republic has shown how disarmament can
be accomplished. The example of France, so entirely
reasonable, so profitable, so pacific, and so harmonious
with ours, would spread. Conquering Germany could
not resist its influence. Nations are taught by example
more than by precept, and either is better than force.
Other nations would follow; nor would Russia, elevated
by her great act of Enfranchisement, fail to seize her
sublime opportunity. Popular rights, which are strongest
always in assured peace, would have new triumphs.
Instead of Trial by Battle for the decision of differences
between nations, there would be peaceful substitutes, as
Arbitration, or, it may be, a Congress of Nations, and
the United States of Europe would appear above the
subsiding waters. The old juggle of Balance of Power,
which has rested like a nightmare on Europe, would
disappear, like that other less bloody fiction of Balance
of Trade, and nations, like individuals, would all be
equal before the law. Here our own country furnishes
an illustration. So long as slavery prevailed among us,
there was an attempt to preserve what was designated
balance of power between the North and South, pivoting
on Slavery,&mdash;just as in Europe there has been an
attempt to preserve balance of power among nations
pivoting on War. Too tardily is it seen that this famous
balance, which has played such a part at home
and abroad, is but an artificial contrivance instituted by
power, which must give place to a simple accord derived
from the natural condition of things. Why should not
the harmony which has begun at home be extended<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
abroad? Practicable and beneficent here, it must be
the same there. Then would nations exist without perpetual
and reciprocal watchfulness. But the first step
is to discard the wasteful, oppressive, and pernicious
provocative to war, which is yet maintained at such terrible
cost. To-day this glorious advance is presented to
France and Germany.</p>


<h4>KING WILLIAM AND COUNT BISMARCK.</h4>

<p>Two personages at this moment hold in their hands
the great question teeming with a new civilization.
Honest and determined, both are patriotic rather than
cosmopolitan or Christian, believing in Prussia rather
than Humanity. And the patriotism so strong in each
keeps still the early tinge of iron. I refer to King
William and his Prime-Minister, Count Bismarck.</p>

<p>More than any other European sovereign, William
of Prussia possesses the infatuation of “divine right.”
He believes that he was appointed by God to be King&mdash;differing
here from Louis Napoleon, who in a spirit
of compromise entitled himself Emperor “by the grace
of God and the national will.” This infatuation was
illustrated at his coronation in ancient Königsberg,&mdash;first
home of Prussian royalty, and better famous as
birthplace and lifelong home of Immanuel Kant,&mdash;when
the King enacted a scene of melodrama which
might be transferred from the church to the theatre.
No other person was allowed to place the crown on his
royal head. Lifting it from the altar, where it rested,
he placed it on his head himself, in sign that he held
it from Heaven and not from man, and next placed another
on the head of the Queen, in sign that her dignity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
was derived from him. Then, turning round, he grasped
the sword of state, in testimony of readiness to defend
the nation. Since the Battle of Sadowa, when the Austrian
Empire was so suddenly shattered, he has believed
himself providential sword-bearer of Germany, destined,
perhaps, to revive the old glories of Barbarossa. His
habits are soldierly, and, notwithstanding his seventy-three
winters, he continues to find pleasure in wearing
the spiked helmet of the Prussian camp. Republicans
smile when he speaks of “my army,” “my allies,” and
“my people”; but this egotism is the natural expression
of the monarchical character, especially where the
monarch believes that he holds by “divine right.” His
public conduct is in harmony with these conditions.
He is a Protestant, and rules the land of Luther, but
he is no friend to modern Reform. The venerable system
of war and prerogative is part of his inheritance
handed down from fighting despots, and he evidently
believes in it.</p>

<p>His Minister, Count Bismarck, is the partisan of “divine
right,” and, like the King, regards with satisfaction
that hierarchical feudalism from which they are both
derived. He is noble, and believes in nobility. He
believes also in force, as if he had the blood of the god
Thor. He believes in war, and does not hesitate to
throw its “iron dice,” insisting upon the rigors of the
game. As the German question began to lower, his
policy was most persistent. “Not by speeches and
votes of the majority,” he said in 1862, “are the great
questions of the time decided,&mdash;that was the error of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
1848 and 1849,&mdash;<em>but by iron and blood</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Thus explicit
was he. Having a policy, he became its representative,
and very soon thereafter controlled the counsels of
his sovereign, coming swiftly before the world; and yet
his elevation was tardy. Born in 1815, he did not enter
upon diplomacy until 1851, when thirty-six years of
age, and only in 1862 became Prussian Minister at
Paris, whence he was soon transferred to the Cabinet
at Berlin as Prime-Minister. Down to that time he
was little known. His name is not found in any edition
of the bulky French Dictionary of Contemporaries,<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a>
not even its “Additions and Rectifications,” until
the Supplement of 1863. But from this time he drew
so large a share of public attention that the contemporary
press of the world became the dictionary where his
name was always found. Nobody doubts his intellectual
resources, his courage, or strength of will; but it is
felt that he is naturally hard, and little affected by human
sympathy. Therefore is he an excellent war minister.
It remains to be seen if he will do as much for
peace. His one idea has been the unity of Germany
under the primacy of Prussia; and here he encountered
Austria, as he now encounters France. But in that
larger unity where nations will be conjoined in harmony
he can do less, so long at least as he continues
a fanatic for kings and a cynic towards popular institutions.</p>

<p>Such is the King, and such his Minister. I have described
them that you may see how little help the great
ideas already germinating from bloody fields will receive
from them. In this respect they are as one.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<h4>TWO INFLUENCES <i>VERSUS</i> WAR SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>Beyond the most persuasive influence of civilization,
pleading, as never before, with voice of reason and affection,
that the universal tyrant and master-evil of
Christendom, the War System, may cease, and the
means now absorbed in its support be employed for the
benefit of the Human Family, there are two special influences
which cannot be without weight at this time.
The first is German authority in the writings of philosophers,
by whom Germany rules in thought; and the
second is the uprising of the working-men: both
against war as acknowledged arbiter between nations,
and insisting upon peaceful substitutes.</p>


<h4>AUTHORITY OF THE GERMAN MIND.</h4>

<p>More than any other nation Germany has suffered
from war. Without that fatal gift of beauty, “a dowry
fraught with never-ending pain,” which tempted the
foreigner to Italy, her lot has been hardly less wretched;
but Germany has differed from Italy in the successful
bravery with which she repelled the invader.
Tacitus says of her people, that, “surrounded by numerous
and very powerful nations, they are safe, not by
obsequiousness, but by battles and braving danger”;<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a>
and this same character, thus epigrammatically presented,
has continued ever since. Yet this was not
without that painful experience which teaches what
Art has so often attempted to picture and Eloquence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span> to
describe, “The Miseries of War.” Again in that same
fearless spirit has Germany driven back the invader,
while War is seen anew in its atrocious works. But it
was not merely the Miseries of War which Germans
regarded. The German mind is philosophical and scientific,
and it early saw the irrational character of the
War System. It is well known that Henry the Fourth
of France conceived the idea of Harmony among Nations
without War; and his plan was taken up and elaborated
in numerous writings by the good Abbé de Saint-Pierre,
so that he made it his own. Rousseau, in his
treatise on the subject,<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> popularized Saint-Pierre. But
it is to Germany that we must look for the most complete
and practical development of this beautiful idea.
If French in origin, it is German now in authority.</p>

<p>The greatest minds in Germany have dealt with this
problem, and given to its solution the exactness of science.
No greater have been applied to any question.
Foremost in this list, in time and in fame, is Leibnitz,
that marvel of human intelligence, second, perhaps, to
none in history, who, on reading the “Project of Perpetual
Peace” by the Abbé de Saint-Pierre, pronounced
this judgment: “I have read it with attention, and am
persuaded that such a project is on the whole feasible,
and that its execution would be one of the most useful
things in the world.”<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> Thus did Leibnitz affirm its
feasibility and its immense usefulness. Other minds
followed, in no apparent concert, but in unison. I may
be pardoned, if, without being too bibliographical, I
name some of these witnesses.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span></p>
<p>At Göttingen, renowned for its University, the question
was opened, at the close of the Seven Years’ War
in 1763, in a work by Totze, whose character appears in
its title, “Permanent and Universal Peace in Europe,
according to the Plan of Henry IV.”<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> At Leipsic, also
the seat of a University, the subject was presented in
1767 by Lilienfeld, in a treatise of much completeness,
under the name of “New Constitution for States,”<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a>
where, after exposing the wretched chances of the battle-field
and the expense of armaments in time of peace,
the author urges submission to Arbitrators, unless a Supreme
Tribunal is established to administer International
Law and to judge between nations. In 1804 appeared
another work, of singular clearness and force, by
Karl Schwab, entitled “Of Unavoidable Injustice,”<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
where the author describes what he calls the Universal
State, in which nations will be to each other as citizens
in the Municipal State. He is not so visionary as to
imagine that justice will always be inviolate between
nations in the Universal State, for it is not always so
between citizens in the Municipal State; but he confidently
looks to the establishment between nations of
the rules which now subsist between citizens, whose differences
are settled peaceably by judicial tribunals.</p>

<p>These works, justly important for the light they shed,
and as expressions of a growing sentiment, are eclipsed
in the contributions of the great teacher, Immanuel
Kant, who, after his fame in philosophy was established,
so that his works were discussed and expounded not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
only throughout Germany, but in other lands, in 1795
gave to the world a treatise entitled “On Perpetual
Peace,”<a name="FNanchor_228_228" id="FNanchor_228_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_228" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> which was promptly translated into French,
Danish, and Dutch. Two other works by him attest
his interest in the subject, the first entitled “Idea for
a General History in a Cosmopolitan View,”<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> and the
other, “Metaphysical Elements of Jurisprudence.”<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
His grasp was complete. A treaty of peace which
tacitly acknowledges the right to wage war, as all treaties
now do, according to Kant is nothing more than a
truce. An individual war may be ended, but not the
<em>state of war</em>; so that, even after cessation of hostilities,
there will be constant fear of their renewal, while the
armaments known as Peace Establishments will tend to
provoke them. All this should be changed, and nations
should form one comprehensive Federation, which, receiving
other nations within its fold, will at last embrace
the civilized world; and such, in the judgment of
Kant, was the irresistible tendency of nations. To a
French poet we are indebted for the most suggestive
term, “United States of Europe”;<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> but this is nothing
but the Federation of the illustrious German philosopher.
Nor was Kant alone among his great contemporaries.
That other philosopher, Fichte, whose name
at the time was second only to that of Kant, in his
“Groundwork of the Law of Nature,”<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> published in
1796, also urges a Federation of Nations, with an established
tribunal to which all should submit. Much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
better for civilization, had the King at Königsberg, instead
of grasping the sword, hearkened to the voice of
Kant, renewed by Fichte.</p>

<p>With these German oracles in its support, the cause
cannot be put aside. Even in the midst of war, Philosophy
will be heard, especially when she speaks words
of concurring authority that touch a chord in every
heart. Leibnitz, Kant, and Fichte, a mighty triumvirate
of intelligence, unite in testimony. As Germany,
beyond any other nation, has given to the idea of Organized
Peace the warrant of philosophy, it only remains
now that she should insist upon its practical application.
There should be no delay. Long enough has
mankind waited while the river of blood flowed on.</p>


<h4>UPRISING OF WORKING-MEN.</h4>

<p>The working-men of Europe, not excepting Germany,
respond to the mandate of Philosophy, and insist that
the War System shall be abolished. At public meetings,
in formal resolutions and addresses, they have declared
war against War, and they will not be silenced.
This is not the first time that working-men have made
themselves heard for international justice. I cannot
forget, that, while Slavery was waging war against our
nation, the working-men of Belgium in public meeting
protested against that precocious Proclamation of Belligerent
Rights by which the British Government gave
such impulse to the Rebellion; and now, in the same
spirit, and for the sake of true peace, they declare themselves
against that War System by which the peace of
nations is placed in such constant jeopardy. They are
right; for nobody suffers in war as the working-ma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>n,
whether in property or in person. For him war is a
ravening monster, devouring his substance, and changing
him from citizen to military serf. As victim of the
War System he is entitled to be heard.</p>

<p>The working-men of different countries have been organizing
in societies, of which it is difficult at present
to tell the number and extent. It is known that these
societies exist in Germany, France, Spain, Italy, and
England, as well as in our own country, and that they
have in some measure an international character. In
France, before the war, there were 433,785 men in the
organization, and in Germany 150,000.<a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> Yet this is but
the beginning.</p>

<p>At the menace of the present war, all these societies
were roused. The society known as the International
Working-Men’s Association, by their General Council,
issued an address, dated at London, protesting against it
as a war of dynasties, denouncing Louis Napoleon as an
enemy of the laboring classes, and declaring “the war-plot
of July, 1870, but an amended edition of the <i>coup
d’état</i> of December, 1851.” The address then testifies
generally against war, saying,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“They feel deeply convinced, that, whatever turn the impending
horrid war may take, <em>the alliance of the working classes
of all countries will ultimately kill war</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At the same time the Paris branch of the International
Association put forth a manifesto addressed “To
the Working-Men of all Countries,” from which I take
these passages:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Once more, under the pretext of European equilibrium,
of national honor, political ambitions menace the peace of the
world.</p>

<p>“French, German, Spanish working-men! <em>let our voices
unite in a cry of reprobation against war!</em></p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“War for a question of preponderance, or of dynasty, can,
in the eyes of working-men, be nothing but a criminal absurdity.</p>

<p>“In response to the warlike acclamations of those who exonerate
themselves from the impost of blood, or who find in
public misfortunes a source of new speculations, we protest,&mdash;we
who wish for peace, work, and liberty.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“Brothers of Germany!… our divisions would only
bring about <em>the complete triumph of despotism on both sides of
the Rhine</em>.</p>

<p class="center">…</p>

<p>“Working-men of all countries! whatever may be the result
of our common efforts, we, members of the International
Association of Working-Men, who know no frontiers, we send
you, as a pledge of indissoluble solidarity, the good wishes
and the salutations of the working-men of France.”<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p>

</div>

<p>To this appeal, so full of truth, touching to the quick
the pretence of balance of power and questions of dynasty
as excuses for war, and then rising to “a cry of
reprobation against war,” the Berlin branch of the International
Association replied:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We join with heart and hand in your protestation.…
Solemnly we promise you that neither the noise of drums nor
the thunder of cannon, neither victory nor defeat, shall turn
us aside from our work for the union of the proletaries of
all countries.”<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>
<p>Then came a meeting of delegates at Chemnitz, in
Saxony, representing fifty thousand Saxon working-men,
which put forth the following hardy words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are happy to grasp the fraternal hand stretched out
to us by the working-men of France.… Mindful of the
watchword of the International Working-Men’s Association,
<em>Proletarians of all countries, unite!</em> we shall never forget
that the working-men of all countries are our friends, and
the despots of all countries our enemies.”<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Next followed, at Brunswick, in Germany, on the 16th
of July,&mdash;the very day after the reading of the war document
at the French tribune, and the “light heart” of
the Prime-Minister,&mdash;a mass meeting of the working-men
there, which declared its full concurrence with the
manifesto of the Paris branch, spurned the idea of national
antagonism to France, and wound up with these
solid words:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“We are enemies of all wars, but above all of dynastic
wars.”<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The whole subject is presented with admirable power
in an address from the Workmen’s Peace Committee to
the Working-Men of Great Britain and Ireland, duly
signed by their officers. Here are some of its sentences:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Without us war must cease; for without us standing
armies could not exist. It is out of our class chiefly that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>they are formed.”</p>

<p>“We would call upon and implore the peoples of France
and Germany, in order to enable their own rulers to realize
these their peace-loving professions, <em>to insist upon the abolition
of standing armies</em>, as both the source and means of
war, nurseries of vice, and locust-consumers of the fruits of
useful industry.”</p>

<p>“What we claim and demand&mdash;what we would implore
the peoples of Europe to do, without regard to Courts, Cabinets,
or Dynasties&mdash;is <em>to insist upon Arbitration as a substitute
for war</em>, with peace and its blessings for them, for us, for
the whole civilized world.”<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

</div>

<p>The working-men of England responded to this appeal,
in a crowded meeting at St. James’s Hall, London,
where all the speakers were working-men and representatives
of the various handicrafts, except the Chairman,
whose strong words found echo in the intense convictions
of the large assemblage:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“One object of this meeting is to make the horror universally
inspired by the enormous and cruel carnage of this
terrible war the groundwork for appealing to the working
classes and the people of all other European countries to join
in protesting against war altogether, [<i>prolonged cheers</i>,] as the
shame of Christendom, and direst curse and scourge of the
human race. Let the will of the people sweep away war,
which cannot be waged without them. [‘<i>Hear!</i>’] Away
with enormous standing armies, [‘<i>Hear!</i>’] the nurseries and
instruments of war,&mdash;nurseries, too, of vice, and crushing
burdens upon national wealth and prosperity! Let there go
forth from the people of this and other lands one universal
and all-overpowering cry and demand for the blessings of
peace!”<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a></p>

</div>

<p>At this meeting the Honorary Secretary of the Workmen’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>s
Peace Committee, after announcing that the working-men
of upwards of three hundred towns had given
their adhesion to the platform of the Committee, thus
showing a determination to abolish war altogether, moved
the following resolution, which was adopted:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That war, especially with the present many fearful contrivances
for wholesale carnage and destruction, is repugnant to
every principle of reason, humanity, and religion; and this
meeting earnestly invites all civilized and Christian peoples
to insist upon the abolition of standing armies, and the settlement
by arbitration of all international disputes.”<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Thus clearly is the case stated by the Working-Men,
now beginning to be heard; and the testimony is reverberated
from nation to nation. They cannot be silent
hereafter. I confidently look to them for important coöperation
in this great work of redemption. Could my
voice reach them now, wherever they may be, in that
honest toil which is the appointed lot of man, it would
be with words of cheer and encouragement. Let them
proceed until civilization is no longer darkened by war.
In this way will they become not only saviours to their
own households, but benefactors of the whole Human
Family.</p>


<h4>ABOLITION OF THE WAR SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>Such is the statement, with its many proofs, by which
war is exhibited as the Duel of Nations, being the Trial
by Battle of the Dark Ages. You have seen how nations,
under existing International Law, to which all are
parties, refer their differences to this insensate arbitrament,&mdash;and
then how, in our day and before our own<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
eyes, two nations eminent in civilization have furnished
an instance of this incredible folly, waging together a
world-convulsing, soul-harrowing, and most barbarous
contest. All ask how long the direful duel will be continued.
Better ask, How long will be continued that
War System by which such a duel is authorized and
regulated among nations? When will this legalized,
organized crime be abolished? When at last will it be
confessed that the Law of Right is the same for nations
as for individuals, so that, if Trial by Battle be impious
for individuals, it is so for nations likewise? Against it
are Reason and Humanity, pleading as never before,&mdash;Economy,
asking for mighty help,&mdash;Peace, with softest
voice praying for safeguard,&mdash;and then the authority of
Philosophy, speaking by some of its greatest masters,&mdash;all
reinforced by the irrepressible, irresistible protest of
working-men in different nations.</p>

<p>Precedents exist for the abolition of this duel, so completely
in point, that, according to the lawyer’s phrase,
they “go on all fours” with the new case. Two of
these have been already mentioned: first, when, at the
Diet of Worms, in 1495, the Emperor Maximilian proclaimed
a permanent peace throughout Germany, and
abolished the “liberty” of Private War; and, secondly,
when, in 1815, the German Principalities stipulated
“under no pretext to make war upon one another, or
to pursue their differences by force of arms.”<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> But
first in time, and perhaps in importance, was the great
Ordinance of St. Louis, King of France, promulgated at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
a Parliament in 1260, where he says: “<em>We forbid battles</em>
[<i>i. e.</i> <span class="smcap">Trials by Battle</span>] <em>to all persons throughout our
dominions, … and in place of battles we put proofs
by witnesses.…</em> <span class="smcap">And these Battles we abolish in
our Dominions forever.</span>”<a name="FNanchor_243_243" id="FNanchor_243_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_243" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> These at the time were
great words, and they continue great as an example.
Their acceptance by any two nations would begin the
work of abolition, which would be completed on their
adoption by a Congress of Nations, taking from war its
existing sanction.</p>


<h4>THE WORLD A GLADIATORIAL AMPHITHEATRE.</h4>

<p>The growing tendencies of mankind have been quickened
by the character of the present war, and the unexampled
publicity with which it has been waged. Never
before were all nations, even those separated by great
spaces, whether of land or ocean, the daily and excited
spectators of the combat. The vast amphitheatre within
which the battle is fought, with the whole heavens for
its roof, is coextensive with civilization itself. The
scene in that great Flavian Amphitheatre, the famous
Colosseum, is a faint type of what we are witnessing;
but that is not without its lesson. Bloody games, where
human beings contended with lions and tigers, imported
for the purpose, or with each other, constituted an institution
of ancient Rome, only mildly rebuked by Cicero,<a name="FNanchor_244_244" id="FNanchor_244_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_244" class="fnanchor">[244]</a>
and adopted even by Titus, in that short reign so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
praised as unspotted by the blood of the citizen.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> One
hundred thousand spectators looked on, while gladiators
from Germany and Gaul joined in ferocious combat; and
then, as blood began to flow, and victim after victim
sank upon the sand, the people caught the fierce contagion.
A common ferocity ruled the scene. As Christianity
prevailed, the incongruity of such an institution
was widely felt; but still it continued. At last an
Eastern monk, moved only by report, journeyed a long
way to protest against the impiety. With noble enthusiasm
he leaped into the arena, where the battle raged,
in order to separate the combatants. He was unsuccessful,
and paid with life the penalty of his humanity.<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a>
But the martyr triumphed where the monk had failed.
Shortly afterwards, the Emperor Honorius, by solemn
decree, put an end to this horrid custom. “The first
Christian Emperor,” says Gibbon, “may claim the honor
of the first edict which condemned the art and amusement
of shedding human blood.”<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> Our amphitheatre is
larger than that of Rome; but it witnesses scenes not
less revolting; nor need any monk journey a long way
to protest against the impiety. That protest can be uttered
by every one here at home. We are all spectators;
and since by human craft the civilized world has
become one mighty Colosseum, with place for everybody,
may we not insist that the bloody games by which
it is yet polluted shall cease, and that, instead of mutual-murdering
gladiators filling the near-brought scene
with death, there shall be a harmonious people, of different
nations, but one fellowship, vying together only
in works of industry and art, inspired and exalted by a
divine beneficence?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>
<p>In presenting this picture I exaggerate nothing. How
feeble is language to depict the stupendous barbarism!
How small by its side the bloody games which degraded
ancient Rome! How pygmy the one, how colossal
the other! Would you know how the combat is conducted?
Here is the briefest picture of the arena by
a looker-on:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Let your readers fancy masses of colored rags glued together
with blood and brains, and pinned into strange shapes
by fragments of bones,&mdash;let them conceive men’s bodies
without heads, legs without bodies, heaps of human entrails
attached to red and blue cloth, and disembowelled corpses
in uniform, bodies lying about in all attitudes, with skulls
shattered, faces blown off, hips smashed, bones, flesh, and
gay clothing all pounded together as if brayed in a mortar
extending for miles, not very thick in any one place, but recurring
perpetually for weary hours,&mdash;and then they cannot,
with the most vivid imagination, come up to the sickening
reality of that butchery.”<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Such a sight would have shocked the Heathen of
Rome. They could not have looked on while the brave
gladiator was thus changed into a bloody hash; least of
all could they have seen the work of slaughter done by
machinery. Nor could any German gladiator have
written the letter I proceed to quote from a German
soldier:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I do not know how it is, but one wholly forgets the danger
one is in, and thinks only of the effect of one’s own bullets,
rejoicing like a child at the sight of the enemy falling
like skittles, and having scarcely a compassionate glance to
spare for the comrade falling at one’s side. One ceases to be
a human being, and turns into a brute, a complete brute.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p>Plain confession! And yet the duel continues. Nor
is there death for the armed man only. Fire mingles
with slaughter, as at Bazeilles. Women and children
are roasted alive, filling the air with suffocating odor,
while the maddened combatants rage against each other.
All this is but part of the prolonged and various spectacle,
where the scene shifts only for some other horror.
Meanwhile the sovereigns of the world sit in their boxes,
and the people everywhere occupy the benches.</p>


<h4>PERIL FROM THE WAR SYSTEM.</h4>

<p>The duel now pending teaches the peril from continuance
of the present system. If France and Germany
can be brought so suddenly into collision on a mere
pretext, what two nations are entirely safe? Where is
the talisman for their protection? None, surely, except
Disarmament, which, therefore, for the interest
of all nations, should be commenced. Prussia is now
an acknowledged military power, armed “in complete
steel,”&mdash;but at what cost to her people, if not to mankind!
Military citizenship, according to Prussian rule,
is military serfdom, and on this is elevated a military
despotism of singular grasp and power, operating
throughout the whole nation, like martial law or a
state of siege. In Prussia the law tyrannically seizes
every youth of twenty, and, no matter what his calling
or profession, compels him to military service for seven
years. Three years he spends in active service in the
regular army, where his life is surrendered to the trade
of blood; then for four years he passes to the reserve,
where he is subject to periodic military drills; then for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
five years longer to the <i>Landwehr</i>, or militia, with liability
to service in the <i>Landsturm</i>, in case of war, until
sixty. Wherever he may be in foreign lands, his military
duty is paramount.</p>

<p>But if this system be good for Prussia, then must it
be equally good for other nations. If this economical
government, with education for all, subordinates the
business of life to the military drill, other nations will
find too much reason for doing the same. Unless the
War System is abandoned, all must follow the successful
example, while the civilized world becomes a busy
camp, with every citizen a soldier, and with all sounds
swallowed up in the tocsin of war. Where, then, are
the people? Where are popular rights? Montesquieu
has not hesitated to declare that the peril to free governments
proceeds from armies, and that this peril is
not corrected even by making them depend directly on
the legislative power. This is not enough. The armies
must be reduced in number and force.<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> Among
his papers, found since his death, is the prediction,
“France will be ruined by the military.”<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> It is the
privilege of genius like that of Montesquieu to lift
the curtain of the future; but even he did not see the
vastness of suffering in store for his country through
those armies against which he warned. For years the
engine of despotism at home, they became the sudden
instrument of war abroad. Without them Louis Napoleon
could not have made himself Emperor, nor could
he have hurried France into the present duel. If needed
in other days, they are not needed now. The War
System, always barbarous, is an anachronism, full of
peril both to peace and liberal institutions.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<h4>PEACE.</h4>

<p>An army is a despotism; military service is a bondage;
nor can the passion for arms be reconciled with a
true civilization. The present failure to acknowledge
this incompatibility is only another illustration how the
clear light of truth is discolored and refracted by an
atmosphere where the cloud of war still lingers. Soon
must this cloud be dispersed. From war to peace is a
change indeed; but Nature herself testifies to change.
Sirius, brightest of all the fixed stars, was noted by
Ptolemy as of reddish hue,<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a> and by Seneca as redder
than Mars;<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> but since then it has changed to white.
To the morose remark, whether in the philosophy of
Hobbes or the apology of the soldier, that man is a
fighting animal and that war is natural, I reply,&mdash;Natural
for savages rejoicing in the tattoo, natural for barbarians
rejoicing in violence, but not natural for man in
a true civilization, which I insist is the natural state to
which he tends by a sure progression. The true state
of Nature is not war, but peace. Not only every war,
but every recognition of war as the mode of determining
international differences, is evidence that we are yet
barbarians,&mdash;and so also is every ambition for empire
founded on force, and not on the consent of the people.
A ghastly, bleeding, human head was discovered
by the early Romans, as they dug the foundations of
that Capitol which finally swayed the world.<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> That
ghastly, bleeding, human head is the fit symbol of military
power.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span></p>
<p>Let the War System be abolished, and, in the glory
of this consummation, how vulgar all that comes from
battle! By the side of this serene, beneficent civilization,
how petty in its pretensions is military power!
how vain its triumphs! At this moment the great
general who has organized victory for Germany is
veiled, and his name does not appear even in the military
bulletins. Thus is the glory of arms passing from
sight, and battle losing its ancient renown. Peace does
not arrest the mind like war. It does not glare like
battle. Its operations, like those of Nature, are gentle,
yet sure. It is not the tumbling, sounding cataract, but
the tranquil, fruitful river. Even the majestic Niagara,
with thunder like war, cannot compare with the peaceful
plains of water which it divides. How easy to see
that the repose of nations, like the repose of Nature, is
the great parent of the most precious bounties vouchsafed
by Providence! Add Peace to Liberty,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“And with that virtue, every virtue lives.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>As peace is assured, the traditional sensibilities of
nations will disappear. Their frontiers will no longer
frown with hostile cannon, nor will their people be
nursed to hate each other. By ties of constant fellowship
will they be interwoven together, no sudden trumpet
waking to arms, no sharp summons disturbing the
uniform repose. By steam, by telegraph, by the press,
have they already conquered time, subdued space,&mdash;thus
breaking down old walls of partition by which
they have been separated. Ancient example loses its
influence. The prejudices of another generation are
removed, and the old geography gives place to a new.
The heavens are divided into constellations, with names<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
from beasts, or from some form of brute force,&mdash;as Leo,
Taurus, Sagittarius, and Orion with his club; but this
is human device. By similar scheme is the earth divided.
But in the sight of God there is one Human
Family without division, where all are equal in rights;
and the attempt to set up distinctions, keeping men
asunder, or in barbarous groups, is a practical denial of
that great truth, religious and political, the Brotherhood
of Man. The Christian’s Fatherland is not merely the
nation in which he was born, but the whole earth appointed
by the Heavenly Father for his home. In this
Fatherland there can be no place for unfriendly boundaries
set up by any,&mdash;least of all, place for the War
System, making nations as hostile camps.</p>

<p>At Lassa, in Thibet, there is a venerable stone in
memory of the treaty between the courts of Thibet and
China, as long ago as 821, bearing an inscription worthy
of a true civilization. From Eastern story learn now
the beauty of peace. After the titles of the two august
sovereigns, the monument proceeds: “These two wise,
holy, spiritual, and accomplished princes, foreseeing the
changes hidden in the most distant futurity, touched
with sentiments of compassion towards their people,
and not knowing, in their beneficent protection, any
difference between their subjects and strangers, have,
after mature reflection and by mutual consent, resolved
to give peace to their people.… In perfect harmony
with each other, they will henceforth be good
neighbors, and will do their utmost to draw still closer
the bonds of union and friendship. Henceforward the
two empires of Han (China) and Pho (Thibet) shall
have fixed boundaries.… In preserving these limits,
the respective parties shall not endeavor to injure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
each other; they shall not attack each other in arms,
or make any more incursions beyond the frontiers now
determined.” Then declaring that the two “must reciprocally
exalt their virtues and banish forever all mistrust
between them, that travellers may be without uneasiness,
that the inhabitants of the villages and fields
may live at peace, and that nothing may happen to
cause a misunderstanding,” the inscription announces,
in terms doubtless Oriental: “This benefit will be extended
to future generations, and the voice of love (towards
its authors) will be heard wherever the splendor of
the sun and the moon is seen. The Pho will be tranquil
in their kingdom, and the Han will be joyful in
their empire.”<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> Such is the benediction which from
early times has spoken from one of the monuments
erected by the god Terminus. Call it Oriental; would
it were universal! While recognizing a frontier, there
is equal recognition of peace as the rule of international
life.</p>


<h4>THE REPUBLIC.</h4>

<p>In the abolition of the War System the will of the
people must become all-powerful, exalting the Republic
to its just place as the natural expression of citizenship.
Napoleon has been credited with the utterance at St.
Helena of the prophecy, that “in fifty years Europe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
would be Republican or Cossack.”<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Evidently Europe
will not be Cossack, unless the Cossack is already
changed to Republican,&mdash;as well may be, when it is
known, that, since the great act of Enfranchisement, in
February, 1861, by which twenty-three millions of serfs
were raised to citizenship, with the right to vote, fifteen
thousand three hundred and fifty public schools have
been opened in Russia. A better than Napoleon, who
saw mankind with truer insight, Lafayette, has recorded
a clearer prophecy. At the foundation of the monument
on Bunker Hill, on the semi-centennial anniversary
of the battle, 17th June, 1825, our much-honored
national guest gave this toast: “Bunker Hill, and the
holy resistance to oppression, which has already enfranchised
the American hemisphere. The next half-century
Jubilee’s toast shall be,&mdash;<em>To Enfranchised
Europe</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> The close of that half-century, already so
prolific, is at hand. Shall it behold the great Jubilee
with all its vastness of promise accomplished? Enfranchised
Europe, foretold by Lafayette, means not
only the Republic for all, but Peace for all; it means
the United States of Europe, with the War System
abolished. Against that little faith through which so
much fails in life, I declare my unalterable conviction,
that “government of the people, by the people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>, and for
the people”&mdash;thus simply described by Abraham
Lincoln<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a>&mdash;is a necessity of civilization, not only because
of that republican equality without distinction of birth
which it establishes, but for its assurance of permanent
peace. All privilege is usurpation, and, like Slavery, a
state of war, relieved only by truce, to be broken by
the people in their might. To the people alone can
mankind look for the repose of nations; but the Republic
is the embodied people. All hail to the Republic,
equal guardian of all, and angel of peace!</p>

<p>Our own part is simple. It is, first, to keep out of
war,&mdash;and, next, to stand firm in those ideas which are
the life of the Republic. Peace is our supreme vocation.
To this we are called. By this we succeed. Our
example is more than an army. But not on this account
can we be indifferent, when Human Rights are
assailed or republican institutions are in question. Garibaldi
asks for a “word,”<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> that easiest expression of
power. Strange will it be, when that is not given. To
the Republic, and to all struggling for Human Rights, I
give word, with heart on the lips. Word and heart I
give. Nor would I have my country forget at any time,
in the discharge of its transcendent duties, that, since
the rule of conduct and of honor is the same for nations
as for individuals, the greatest nation is that which does
most for Humanity.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PATRIOT_DEAD_AT_ARLINGTON" id="THE_PATRIOT_DEAD_AT_ARLINGTON"></a>THE PATRIOT DEAD AT ARLINGTON.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, on a Joint Resolution to
remove their Remains, December 13, 1870.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>Mr. McCreery, of Kentucky, asked leave to introduce a Joint Resolution,
providing for the return of the ground at Arlington to the family
of General Robert E. Lee, “and if graveyards have been established
on the land, then the Committee shall ascertain and report the number
of interments, on what terms a suitable spot for a cemetery can be purchased
in the neighborhood, and the probable cost of removing the
bodies to the new place of sepulture.”</p>

<p>On the question, “Will the Senate grant leave to introduce the
Joint Resolution?” Mr. Edmunds, of Vermont, demanded the yeas and
nays, when a debate ensued, in which Mr. Sumner spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;Being called to vote on the
pending motion, I make haste to say that I
wish on this occasion to apply the Parliamentary Law
in its strongest form. Whatever rigors it may have
against propositions inopportune or offensive in character
must be applied now, or never be invoked again;
for never before in this Chamber was there similar occasion
for these rigors. Therefore shall I vote for the
most summary disposition of this joint resolution.</p>

<p>Beyond this, perhaps, there is no occasion for remark,
especially when I consider how eloquent Senators have
already characterized the proposition and the traitor it
seeks to commemorate. I am not disposed to speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
General Lee. It is enough to say that he stands high
on the catalogue of those who have imbrued their hands
in their country’s blood. I hand him over to the avenging
pen of History.</p>

<p>But there is one practical remark that I would make.
I would call the attention of the Senate to this proposition
in another aspect. We all know the political
associations of the honorable Senator who introduces
it. Must we not regard this joint resolution as revealing
the sentiments of his associates? Does it not prefigure
the policy they would establish, should they obtain
power, as threatened by the Senator from Delaware,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Saulsbury</span>,] as threatened by other Senators and by
other associates of these Senators? Do we not see here
the policy that would be established,&mdash;a policy which
would take the old Rebellion by the hand and install it
in the high places of power,&mdash;in the Executive Mansion,&mdash;in
these Halls of Congress?</p>

<p>Now, Sir, could I make my voice heard from one end
of this country to the other, from Massachusetts to
Louisiana, it would be to warn against that political
combination which shows itself now in the proposition
of the Senator from Kentucky. Take warning, I would
say to my fellow-countrymen everywhere, not only at
the South, but at the North, but especially at the South,
that the political party with which the Senator is associated,
should it obtain power in this nation, will establish
the policy of which his joint resolution is the expression.
That is the practical remark I have to make.</p>

<p>There is a fact which I think I ought to contribute to
this debate. It so happened that I was with the late
Mr. Stanton when he made the order for the burial of
our patriot dead on the grounds of Arlington. H<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>e mentioned
it, and disclosed to me his reason. He meant to
bury those dead in perpetual guard over that ground,
so that no person of the family of Lee should ever dare
to come upon it, unless to encounter patriot ghosts
counted by the thousand. In such spirit the ground
was set apart. And now we are asked to dig up these
dead and give over their resting-place to the traitor
family.</p>

<p>My friend by my side [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>] has already used an
expression which I think a happy inspiration, when he
said that those dead lying there are as sacred as the
Constitution itself. He was right. We may as well
disturb our sacred text as disturb them. Over every
grave are written words of warning. Do you remember,
Sir, that most memorable epitaph over the remains
of William Shakespeare?&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Good friend, for Jesus’ sake forbear</div>
<div class="verse">To dig the dust inclosèd here:</div>
<div class="verse">Blest be the man that spares these stones,</div>
<div class="verse">And curst be he that moves my bones!”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">For two centuries and a half these words have guarded
the immortal dust of England’s greatest poet. I write
them now over the graves of our patriot dead, one and
all. May they continue for centuries to guard their
repose!</p>

<p>On the question of giving leave, the vote stood 4 yeas to 54 nays.
The yeas were Messrs. Fowler of Tennessee, Hamilton and Vickers of

<p>“And it came to pass after these things, that Naboth, the Jezreëlite,
had a vineyard, which was in Jezreël, hard by the palace of Ahab, king
of Samaria.</p>

<p>“And Ahab spake unto Naboth, saying, Give me thy vineyard,
that I may have it for a garden of herbs, <em>because it is near unto my
house</em>; and I will give thee for it a better vineyard than it: or, if it
seem good to thee, <em>I will give thee the worth of it in money</em>.</p>

</div>

<hr class="r15" />

<p>In his Message at the opening of Congress, December 5, 1870, President
Grant, adverting to the failure of the treaty for the annexion of
San Domingo to the United States at the previous session, for want of
the requisite two-thirds vote of the Senate, proceeded to remark:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I was thoroughly convinced then that the best interests of this country,
commercially and materially, demanded its ratification. Time has only
confirmed me in this view. I now firmly believe that the moment it is
known that the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accepting
as a part of its territory the island of San Domingo a free port
will be negotiated for by European nations in the Bay of Samana. A large
commercial city will spring up to which we will be tributary without receiving
corresponding benefits, and then will be seen the folly of our rejecting
so great a prize.”</p>

</div>

<p>After setting forth at much length the great value of this prize, the
President concluded as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In view of the importance of this question, I earnestly urge upon
Congress early action, expressive of its views as to the best means of acquiring
San Domingo. My suggestion is, that by joint resolution of the
two Houses of Congress the Executive be authorized to appoint a commission
to negotiate a treaty with the authorities of San Domingo for the
acquisition of that island, and that an appropriation be made to defray the
expenses of such commission. The question may then be determined,
either by the action of the Senate upon the treaty, or the joint action of
the two Houses of Congress upon a resolution of annexation, as in the case
of the acquisition of Texas. So convinced am I of the advantages to flow
from the acquisition of San Domingo, and of the great disadvantages, I
might almost say calamities, to flow from non-acquisition, that I believe
the subject has only to be investigated to be approved.”</p>

</div>

<p>As preliminary to action upon this recommendation of the President,
Mr. Sumner, December 9th, offered the following resolution:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved</i>, That the President of the United States be requested to
communicate to the Senate, if in his opinion not incompatible with the public
interest, copies of all papers and correspondence relating to the proposed
annexion of the Dominican portion of the island of San Domingo
or the purchase of any part thereof, including the original and all subsequent
instructions to any agent or consul of the United States, with the
correspondence of such agent or consul; also, any protocol or convention
signed by such agent or consul; also, an account of the debt and liabilities
of the Dominican Government, especially its obligations to the neighboring
Republic of Hayti; also, the provisions of the existing Constitution of
Dominica, so far as the same relate to the sale or transfer of the national
domain; also, any treaty with Hayti or France by which Dominica is
bound or affected; also, any communication from the neighboring Republic
of Hayti, or from our Minister there, relating to the proposed annexion;
also, instructions to the commander of our naval squadron in the waters of
the island since the commencement of the late negotiations, with the reports
and correspondence of such commander; also, any information tending
to show what European power, if any, proposes to acquire jurisdiction
of any part of the island, and if so, of what part; also, any information with
regard to the position of President Baez, under whom the treaty of annexion
was negotiated, and the extent to which he has been maintained in
power by the presence of United States vessels of war; also, any information
with regard to the sentiments of the people in Dominica and the
reported pendency there of civil war; also, any information with regard to
any claim of jurisdiction by the Republic of Hayti over the territory of
Dominica.”</p>

</div>

<p>December 12th, in pursuance of the President’s recommendation,
Mr. Morton, of Indiana, asked, and by unanimous consent obtained,
leave to introduce “a Joint Resolution authorizing the appointment of
commissioners in relation to the Republic of Dominica,” as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<i>Resolved, &amp;c.</i>, That the President of the United States be authorized
to appoint three commissioners, and also a secretary, (the latter to be
versed in the English and Spanish languages,) to proceed to the island of
San Domingo, and to inquire into, ascertain, and report:&mdash;</p>

<p>“1. The political state and condition of the Republic of Dominica.</p>

<p>“2. The desire and disposition of the people of the said Republic to become
annexed to and to form part of the people of the United States.</p>

<p>“3. The physical, mental, and moral condition of the said people, and
their general condition as to material wealth and industrial capacity.</p>

<p>“4. The resources of the country; its mineral and agricultural products;
the products of its waters and forests; the general character of the soil; the
extent and proportion thereof capable of cultivation; the climate and
health of the country; its bays, harbors, and rivers; its general meteorological
character, and the existence and frequency of remarkable meteorological
phenomena.</p>

<p>“5. The debt of the Government, and its obligations, whether funded and
ascertained and admitted, or unadjusted and under discussion.</p>

<p>“6. Treaties or engagements with other powers.</p>

<p>“7. Extent of boundaries and territory; what proportion is covered by
grants or concessions, and generally what concessions or franchises have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>been granted.</p>

<p>“8. The terms and conditions on which the Dominican Government may
desire to be annexed to and become part of the United States as one of the
Territories thereof.</p>

<p>“9. Such other information with respect to the said Government or its
territories as to the said commissioners shall seem desirable or important
with reference to the future incorporation of the said Dominican Republic
into the United States as one of its Territories.</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Sec.</span> 2. <i>And be it further resolved</i>, That the said commissioners shall,

<hr class="chap" />

<h3>SPEECH.</h3>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;The resolution before the Senate
commits Congress to a dance of blood. It is
a new step in a measure of violence. Already several
steps have been taken, and Congress is now summoned
to another.</p>

<p>Before I proceed with the merits of this question, so
far as such language can be used with reference to it,
and as I see the Senator from Ohio [Mr. <span class="smcap">Sherman</span>] in
his seat, I wish to answer an argument of his yesterday.
He said that the resolution was simply one of inquiry,
and that therefore there could be no objection to it. I
was astonished when I heard one of his experience in
this Chamber and his familiarity with legislation characterize
the pending proposition simply as a resolution
of inquiry. The Senator is mistaken. It is a joint
resolution creating three offices under the Constitution
of the United States, offices contemplated in the Constitution
itself, and specially mentioned by name in the
Act of 1856 to regulate the diplomatic and consular systems
of the United States.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> I read the first section of
that Act, as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That ambassadors, envoys extraordinary and ministers
plenipotentiary, ministers resident, <em>commissioners</em>, chargés
d’affaires, and secretaries of legation, appointed to the countries
hereinafter named in Schedule A, shall be entitled to
compensation for their services, respectively, at the rates per
annum hereinafter specified: that is to say, ambassadors and
envoys extraordinary and ministers plenipotentiary, the full
amounts specified therefor in said Schedule A; ministers resident
and <em>commissioners</em>, seventy-five per centum.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now, Sir, by this joint resolution the President is
authorized to appoint three “commissioners,” and also a
“secretary,” the latter to be versed in the English and
Spanish languages, to proceed to the island of San Domingo,
and to inquire into, ascertain, and report certain
things. I say this is a legislative act creating three
new offices; but the Senator says that it is simply a
resolution of inquiry. Even suppose the offices are not
diplomatic, they are none the less offices. Let me put
a question to the Senator. Suppose a joint resolution
were brought forward authorizing the appointment of
three commissioners to proceed to England in order to
ascertain the condition of United States securities and
the possibility of finding a market there; according to
his assumption it would be a resolution of inquiry only.
Would he allow it to pass without reference to the Committee
on Finance? Would he not insist that it was a
legislative act opening a most important question, which
should be considered by the appropriate committee?</p>

<p>The Senator is too experienced to be put aside by the
suggestion that the commissioners shall serve without
compensation except the payment of expenses. Does
this alter the case? Without those words in this joint
resolution the general diplomatic law would take effect,
and it would at least be a question if they would <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>not
be entitled to the salary of $7,500 per annum. And
yet a joint resolution creating three new offices is called
simply a resolution of inquiry! Sir, the Senator is
mistaken; and his mistake in this matter illustrates
other mistakes with reference to the important subject
now before the Senate.</p>

<p>Is it right that these commissioners shall serve without
compensation? Is not the laborer worthy of his
hire? If they are proper men, if among them is that
illustrious Professor, my much-honored friend, who has
been referred to already, Mr. Agassiz, is it right to expect
him to give his invaluable services without compensation?
The requirement that the service shall be
of this kind will necessarily limit it either to the rich
or to the partisan. It does not open a free field to
talent, to fitness, to those various qualities so important
on the commission.</p>

<p>I hope that the Senator will reconsider his judgment,
that he will see that we cannot treat the pending proposition
with the levity&mdash;he will pardon me&mdash;with
which he treated it. Sir, it is something more than a
resolution of inquiry. It is a serious measure, and it
begins on its face by an affront to the Constitution of
the United States, which expressly declares that the
President “shall nominate, and, by and with the advice
and consent of the Senate, shall appoint, ambassadors,
other public ministers, and consuls”; but by this resolution
he is to appoint commissioners without the advice
and consent of the Senate; and yet this resolution
is accepted by my honorable friend, the Senator from
Ohio.</p>

<p>The Senator, it seems to me, has not comprehended
the object of this resolution. To my mind it is plain.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
It is simply to commit Congress to the policy of annexion.
I insist upon this point: the object of the resolution,
and I will demonstrate it, is to commit Congress
to the policy of annexion. Otherwise, why is the
resolution introduced? The President does not need
it. Under existing powers he is authorized to appoint
agents, if he pleases, to visit foreign countries, and he is
supplied with a secret-service fund by which their expenses
may be defrayed. The President does not need
this resolution. It is an act of supererogation, so far as
he is concerned; and it is also contrary, so far as I am
informed, to the precedents of our history.</p>

<p>Agents of an informal character, informally called
Commissioners, and not acting under any statute, have
been appointed in times past by the Executive. I have
a memorandum before me of several occasions. In
1811-12 the President dispatched Mr. Poinsett and
Mr. Scott to Buenos Ayres and Caracas to ascertain
the condition of those two countries, with a view to the
recognition of their independence. In 1817 he dispatched
Mr. Bland, Mr. Rodney, and Mr. Graham to
Buenos Ayres again, and also to Chili; and in 1820
he dispatched Mr. Prevost and Mr. Forbes: all for the
same object. The reports of those gentlemen will be
found spread out at length in the State Papers of our
country, printed by the authority of Congress; but you
will search in vain through your statute-book for any
act or joint resolution creating the Commission. It
was constituted by the President himself, with the assistance
of the Secretary of State; and it was to the
Secretary of State that the Commission reported, and
the President communicated their report to Congress.</p>

<p>Therefore do I say, this joint resolution, as it now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
stands, is entirely unnecessary. The President has all
the power it pretends to give. He may, if he sees fit,
appoint agents,&mdash;calling them by any name that he
pleases, calling them commissioners or anything else,&mdash;he
may appoint agents to any extent, of any number,
to visit this island and report with regard to its
condition. He may give in charge to his envoys all the
matters named in this joint resolution. All these he
may write in their commission; and when they return,
he may, as was done in other days, communicate their
report to Congress.</p>

<p>Therefore do I say, the joint resolution is absolutely
unnecessary; and I call the attention of my honored
friend, the Senator from Indiana, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>,] who
champions it, to this special point. I ask him to show
its necessity; I ask him to show any good purpose it
can serve; I ask him to show why it is brought forward
on this occasion, unless to commit Congress to the policy
of annexion. Sir, I stand on this position; and I say,
knowing the powers of the President under this Government,
knowing the practice of this Government, that this
resolution is completely superfluous, and that its single
purpose, so far as one can see any purpose in its terms,
is to commit Congress to what I shall show in a very
few moments is a most unjustifiable policy.</p>

<p>Sir, others may do as they please; others may accept
this policy; I will not. I have already set myself
against it, and I continue now as firm against it as
ever. The information which I have received since
our discussions last year has confirmed me in the conclusions
which I felt it my duty then to announce. In
now presenting those conclusions I beg to say that I
shall forbear considering whether the territory <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>of Dominica
is desirable or not; I shall forbear considering
its resources, even its finances, even its debt,&mdash;menacing
as I know it is to the Treasury of our country,&mdash;except
so far as that debt brings Hayti into this debate.
Some other time these other topics will be proper for
consideration; for the present I shall confine myself to
grounds on which there can be no just difference.</p>

<p>I object to this proposition because it is a new stage
in a measure of violence, which, so far as it has been
maintained, has been upheld by violence. I use strong
language, but only what the occasion requires. As Senator,
as patriot, I cannot see my country suffer in its
good name without an earnest effort to save it.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The negotiation for annexion began with a person
known as Buenaventura Baez. All the evidence, official
and unofficial, shows him to be a political jockey.
But he could do little alone; he had about him two
other political jockeys, Cazneau and Fabens; and these
three together, a precious copartnership, seduced into
their firm a young officer of ours, who entitled himself
“Aide-de-Camp to the President of the United States.”
Together they got up what was called a protocol, in
which the young officer entitling himself “Aide-de-Camp
to the President” proceeds to make certain promises
for the President. Before I read from this document,
I desire to say that there is not one word showing
that at the time this “Aide-de-Camp” had any title
or any instruction to take this step. If he had, that title
and that instruction have been withheld; no inquiry
has been able to penetrate it. At least the committe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>e<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
which brought out the protocol did not bring out any
such authority. The document is called “a protocol,”
which I need not remind you, Sir, is in diplomatic
terms the first draught of a treaty, or the memorandum
between two powers in which are written down the
heads of some subsequent convention; but at the time
it is hardly less binding than a treaty itself, except, as
you are well aware, that under the Constitution of the
United States it can receive no final obligation without
the consent of the Senate. This document begins
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The following bases, which shall serve for framing a
definitive treaty between the United States and the Dominican
Republic, have been reduced to writing and agreed
upon by General Orville E. Babcock, Aide-de-Camp to his
Excellency, General Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United
States of America, and his special agent to the Dominican
Republic, and Mr. Manuel Maria Gautier, Secretary of State
of the Departments of the Interior and of Police, charged with
the foreign relations of the said Dominican Republic.”<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

</div>

<p>Here you see how this young officer, undertaking to
represent the United States of America, entitles himself
“Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency, General Ulysses
S. Grant, President of the United States of America,
and his special agent to the Dominican Republic.” Sir,
you have experience in the Government of this country;
your post is high, and I ask you, Do you know any such
officer in our Government as “Aide-de-Camp to his Excellency,
the President of the United States”? Does
such designation appear in the Constitution, in any
statute, or in the history of this Republic anywhere?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
If it does, your information, Sir, is much beyond mine.
I have never before met any such instance. This young
officer stands alone in using the lofty title. I believe,
still further, that he stands alone in the history of free
governments. I doubt whether you can find a diplomatic
paper anywhere in which any person undertaking
to represent his Government has entitled himself Aide-de-Camp
of the chief of the State. The two duties are
incompatible, according to all the experience of history.
No aide-de-camp would be appointed commissioner;
and the assumption of this exalted and exceptional
character by this young officer shows at least his inexperience
in diplomacy, if not his ambition to play a
great part. Doubtless it had an effect with Baez, Cazneau,
and Fabens, the three confederates. They were
pleased with the eminence of the agent. It helped on
the plan they were engineering.</p>

<p>The young aide-de-camp then proceeds to pledge the
President as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I. His Excellency, General Grant, President of the
United States, promises, <em>privately</em>, to use all his influence,
in order that the idea of annexing the Dominican Republic
to the United States may acquire such a degree of popularity
among members of Congress as will be necessary for its accomplishment.”</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Shall I read the rest of the document? It is of
somewhat the same tenor. There are questions of
money in it, cash down, all of which must have been
particularly agreeable to the three confederates. It
finally winds up as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Done in duplicate, <em>in good faith</em>, in the City of San Domingo,
the 4th day of the month of September, A. D. 1869.</p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="smcap">Orville E. Babcock.</span></p>

<p class="sig">“<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span><span class="smcap">Manuel Maria Gautier.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p>“In good faith,” if you please, Sir.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that Orville E. Babcock did not
write “Aide-de-Camp” against his name at the bottom
of the protocol. This was not necessary. The designation
of a person in such documents always appears
at the beginning,&mdash;as, for instance, in a deed between
two parties. It is not written against the name.</p>

<p>Therefore we have here a “protocol,” so entitled,
signed by a young officer who entitles himself “Aide-de-Camp
to his Excellency, the President of the United
States,” and who promises for the President that he
shall privately use all his influence in order that the
idea of annexing the Dominican Republic to the United
States may acquire such a degree of popularity among
members of Congress as will be necessary for its accomplishment.
Such was the promise. Senators about
me know how faithfully the President has fulfilled it,
how faithfully he has labored, privately and publicly,
even beyond the protocol,&mdash;the protocol only required
that he should work privately,&mdash;privately and publicly,
in order that the idea of annexing the Dominican Republic
should be agreeable to Congress.</p>

<p>The young officer, “Aide-de-Camp to the President
of the United States,” with this important and unprecedented
document in his pocket, returned to Washington.
Instead of being called to account for this unauthorized
transaction, pledging the Chief Magistrate to use his
influence privately with Congress in order to cram down
a measure that the confederates justly supposed to be
offensive, he was sent back with directions to negotiate
a treaty. I would not allude to that treaty, if it had
not been made the subject of discussion by <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>the President
himself in his Annual Message. You know it.
The treaty itself is not on your tables legislatively; it
has never been communicated legislatively to Congress.
The other House, which may be called to act upon this
important measure, can know nothing of that treaty,
and what we know of it we cannot speak of even in
this debate. We can simply speak of its existence, for
the President himself has imparted that to Congress
and to the country. The treaty exists; and now the
practical question is, By what means was it negotiated?
I have described to you the three confederates who seduced
into their company the aide-de-camp of the President;
and now I have to aver, and I insist that the
evidence will substantiate what I say, that at the time
of the signature of the treaty of annexion Baez was
sustained in power by the presence of our naval force
in the waters of the Dominican Government. Go to
the documents, and you will find that what I say is
true. Confer with naval officers, confer with honest
patriot citizens who know the case, and they will all
testify that without the presence of our ships-of-war in
those waters Baez would have been powerless.</p>

<p>This is not all, Sir; I broaden the allegation. Ever
since the signature of the treaty, and especially since
its rejection, Baez has been sustained in power by the
presence of our naval force. Such I aver to be the fact.
I state it with all the responsibility of my position, and
with full conviction of its truth. I ask you, Sir, to go
to the State Department and Navy Department and
read the reports there on file, and I feel sure that what
I state will be found to be substantially true. I ask
you also to confer with any naval officer who has been
there, or with any patriot citizen.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span></p>
<p>Sir, this is a most serious business. Nothing more
important to the honor of the Republic has occurred for
long years. How many of us now are hanging with
anxiety on the news from Europe! There stand matched
in deadly combat two great historic foes, France and
Germany,&mdash;France now pressed to the wall; and what
is the frequent report? That Bismarck may take Louis
Napoleon from his splendid prison and place him again
on the throne of France, there to obtain from him that
treaty of surrender which the Republic never will sign.
Are we not all indignant at the thought? Why, Sir, it
was only the other day that a member of the Cabinet,
at my own house, in conversation on this question, said
that nothing could make him more angry than the
thought that Bismarck could play such a part, and that
by this device France might be despoiled. And now,
Sir, this is the very part played by the American Government.
Baez has been treated as you fear Bismarck
may treat Louis Napoleon. You call him “President”;
they call him there “Dictator”; better call him “Emperor,”
and then the parallel will be complete. He is
sustained in power by the Government of the United
States that he may betray his country. Such is the
fact, and I challenge any Senator to deny it. I submit
myself to question, and challenge the Senator from
Indiana, who, as I have already said, champions this
proposition, to deny it. I challenge him to utter one
word of doubt of the proposition which I now lay down,
that Baez is maintained in power by the naval force of
the United States, and that, being in power, we seek to
negotiate with him that he may sell his country. It
cannot be denied. Why, Sir, the case has a parallel in
earlier days,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton</span> rose.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Allow me to give one more illustration,
and then the Senator may interfere.&mdash;It has a
parallel in earlier days, when the British Government
selected the king of the Mosquitoes as their puppet on
the margin of Central America. They called the Indian
chief a king, and actually sent to him certain “regalia”
and other signs of royal honor, and then, pretending to
act under him, they claimed the jurisdiction of that region.
Are we not now treating Baez in some measure
as England treated the Mosquito king?</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask him a
question?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Certainly.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> If this Commission go down there, they
can return an answer to all these broad statements of the
Senator, whether they are true or not. The Senator understands
that; but I wish to ask him if he does not know, that,
in answer to all this that he is talking about, it has been
urged that all parties in San Domingo, whether they are for
Baez or Cabral, or whoever they are for, are for annexation?
If that is true, all this is utterly immaterial, except as something
thrown in to obscure this subject before the public. I
aver&mdash;and the Commission will show it&mdash;that all parties,
whether against the Baez Government or for it, are equally
for annexation; and if that is true, all this is frivolous.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Mr. President, I alluded yesterday to
the late Prime-Minister of France, who said that he
accepted war “with a light heart.”<a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> The Senator from
Indiana speaks in the same vein. He says that my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
allegation is “frivolous.” Sir, never was there a more
important allegation brought forward in this Chamber.
Frivolous! Is it frivolous, when I see the flag of my
country prostituted to an act of wrong? Is it frivolous,
when I see the mighty power of this Republic degraded
to an act of oppression? Nothing frivolous&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Edmunds.</span> What do you say as to the point, What
are the wishes of the people of that country?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I was remarking on the charge of
frivolity; perhaps the Senator will let me finish on
that head; I had not finished.&mdash;I say that there is
nothing frivolous in the suggestion; I insist that it is
grave. It is too grave; it is oppressive to this Government
and this country. The Senator from Indiana
asks, Why not send out this Commission?&mdash;he always
comes back to his Commission,&mdash;Why not send these
men out? I say, Why send them out, when we now
have in the archives of this Republic evidence that this
very Baez is sustained in power by the naval force of
the United States, and that he now looks to this force
for protection? Can you send out a commission under
such circumstances without making yourself a party to
the transaction?</p>

<p>And now I answer still further. The Senator asks if
I am not aware that all persons there are in favor of
annexion,&mdash;and the inquiry is repeated by my friend,
the Senator from Vermont. I answer categorically, No,
I am not aware of it; I understand the contrary. I
have at least as good information as any accessible during
the last week, and it is not four days old, just to the
contrary. There are two chieftains in Dominica: one
the political jockey with whom our Government has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
united, and who is now sustained in power by our naval
force; and the other is Cabral, who, as I have been assured
by one who is bound to be well-informed, represents
the people of his country, besides being <i>de jure</i> its
head. Some time ago Cabral favored the sale of the
Bay of Samana to the United States; but I am assured
that he has never favored annexion to the United States.
I am assured that his policy is to bring the two Governments
of Dominica and Hayti once more together, as
they were down to the revolution and war which lasted
from 1844 to 1848, terminating in the uncertain independence
of the Dominican part of the island.</p>

<p>Now I have answered categorically the inquiries of
my two friends. The evidence, as I have it, is not that
these two chieftains are agreed. On the contrary, there
is between them discord; they differ from each other,&mdash;one
seeking unity for these two Governments, the other
seeking to sell his country for a price. But, whatever
may be the sentiment of the people, whether Baez and
Cabral agree or disagree, I come back to the single practical
point that Baez has been, and is now, maintained
in power by the naval force of the United States. Deny
it, if you can. All this is still worse, when it is considered
that the very Constitution of Dominica, under
which the adventurer professes to hold rule, provides
that there shall be no transfer to any foreign power of
any portion of the country.</p>

<p>Now, Sir, try this again. Suppose during our civil
war Louis Napoleon, in an evil hour, had undertaken to
set up Jefferson Davis as the head of this Government,
and then to make a treaty with him by which Texas,
said to have been much coveted by the Emperor, should
be yielded and become part of Mexico, which itself w<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>as
to become more or less part of France. Suppose Louis
Napoleon had undertaken such an enterprise, how should
we feel? Would not the blood boil? Would it be
commended at all because we were told that there were
large numbers in the Southern States who favored it?
And yet this is precisely what the United States are
now doing in the Bay of Samana and the port of San
Domingo.</p>

<p>This may be seen in another light. We complain of
taxes. Do you know what we have paid during this
year in carrying out this sorrowful policy? I have here
an article which I cut from a New York paper last evening,
being a letter from San Domingo City, dated December
6, 1870, from which I will read a sentence:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The United States war-steamer Swatara is on a cruise,
the Yantic is at San Domingo City, and the Nantasket is at
Samana.”</p>

</div>

<p>Three ships out of the small Navy of the United
States occupying these waters to enforce this policy!
If force were not to be employed, why these three
ships? why the necessity of any ship? Tell me. Can
there be good reason?</p>

<p>When I think of all this accumulated power in those
waters, those three war-vessels, with the patronage naturally
incident to their presence, it is not astonishing
that there is on the seaboard, immediately within their
influence, a certain sentiment in favor of annexion. But
when you penetrate the interior, beyond the sight of
their smoke, at least beyond the influence of their
money, it is otherwise. There the sentiment is adverse.
There it is Cabral who prevails. So, at least, I am assured.
But whether one or the other prevails, the objec<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>tion
is the same. You violate the first principles of
self-government and of constitutional liberty, when you
lend your power to either.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Sir, I have presented but half of this case, and perhaps
the least painful part. I am now brought to another
aspect of it. This naval force to which I have
referred has also been directed against the neighboring
Republic of Hayti (the only colored Government now
existing in the world, a republic seeking to follow our
great example,) penetrating its harbors and undertaking
to dictate what it should do. If you will read again
the reports at the Navy Department, you will find that
I do not overstate when I say that they have undertaken
to dictate to the Government of Hayti what it should
do. Nor is this all. In an unhappy moment, the commodore
of an American fleet, going ashore, allowed himself
to insult and menace the Government there, saying,
that, if it interfered in any way with the territory of
Dominica, he would blow the town down. So I have
been informed by one who ought to know. You look
grave, Sir. Well you may. I wish I could give you
the official evidence on this assumption; but I am assured,
on evidence which I regard as beyond question,
that this incident has occurred. In what school was our
commodore reared? The prudent mother in the story
cautioned her son to take care never to fight with a boy
of his own size. An American commodore, in the same
spirit, undertakes to insult a sister republic too weak to
resist. Of course, if he did this on his own motion and
without instructions from Washington, he ought to be
removed,&mdash;and, in my judgment, rather than carry out
such instruct<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>ions, he ought to have thrown his sword
into the sea.</p>

<p>Senators murmur. There is a rule of morals and of
honor above all other rules, and no officer of Army or
Navy can consent to do an act of wrong. This was the
voice of our fathers during the Revolution. How we
praised and glorified those British officers who refused
to serve against them, generously sacrificing their commissions
rather than enforce a tyranny! Often have I
honored in my heart of hearts that great man, one of
the greatest in English history, Granville Sharp, foremost
of all England’s Abolitionists, because, while an
humble clerk, and poor, in one of the departments in
London, he resigned his post rather than sustain that policy
toward the Colonies which he regarded as wrong.</p>

<p>No naval officer should have allowed himself to use
such a menace toward this weak republic. By its very
weakness was it entitled to kindness; and yet, Sir, its
weakness was the occasion for the insult it received.
Think you, Sir, that he would have used such language
toward England or France? I think not.</p>

<p>All this is aggravated, when we consider the relations
between Dominica and Hayti, and bring this incredible
transaction to the touchstone of International Law.
Dominica and Hayti became one under President Boyer
in 1822, and the whole island continued as a unit until
1844, when Dominica rose against Hayti, and, after a
bloody conflict of four years, in 1848 succeeded in securing
its independence.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Mr. President,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The Vice-President.</span> Does the Senator from Massachusetts
yield to the Senator from Indiana?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Yes, Sir.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Will the Senator allow me to suggest that it
might help to a better understanding of the proposition he is
about to state, if he will say that they became one by the conquest
of Hayti,&mdash;not by consent, but by force of arms?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I said that they became one in 1822,
and that they continued one till 1844. To what extent
arms played a part I have not said. Suffice it to say
that Dominica constituted part of the Government of
Hayti, which was administered under the name of
Hayti. In 1838, while the two constituted one Government,
a treaty was made with France, which I have
before me, by which the Haytian Government agreed
to pay, in certain annual instalments, the sum of sixty
million francs. Since the separation of the two, Hayti
has proceeded with those payments, and I think the
Senator over the way will not deny that there is at
least ground of claim on the part of Hayti against Dominica
for contribution to those payments.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Will the Senator allow me to ask him a
question about that?&mdash;because I do not desire to take up the
time of the Senate in answering him,&mdash;and that is this:
Whether the debt for which Hayti agreed to pay France
sixty million francs was not for spoliations upon the property
of French citizens in Hayti, and not in Dominica, and with
which Dominica never had anything to do? That is the
fact about it.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Nothing is said in the treaty before
me of the consideration for these payments.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> The history of the transaction shows that.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> History shows, however, that the two
Governments were one at this time, and I have to s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>ubmit
that there is at least a question whether Dominica
is not liable to Hayti on that account. All will see the
question, while Hayti insists upon the liability of Dominica.
I mention this that you may see the relation
between the two Governments.</p>

<p>But this is not all. Besides the treaty with France,
there is another between Hayti and Dominica. I have
no copy of it. The resolution which I introduced the
other day calls for it. I became acquainted with it
through the protest which I hold in my hand, made by
the Government of Hayti to Mr. Seward, as Secretary
of State, and dated at Washington the 5th of February,
1868, against the sale and purchase of the Bay of Samana.
In the course of this protest I find the following
allegation:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“That there is a treaty between the Government of Hayti
and that of San Domingo to the effect that no part of the
island can be alienated by either of the two Governments.”</p>

</div>

<p>Now the point which I present to the Senate, and
seek to impress, is, that Hayti, having these claims on
Dominica, is interdicted from their pursuit by an American
commodore.</p>

<p>But perhaps I may be told&mdash;I see my friend, the
Senator from Indiana, is taking notes&mdash;that the American
commodore was justified under the Law of Nations.
I meet him on that point. How could he be justified?
How could the Law of Nations sanction such a wrong?
The only ground would be, that during the pendency of
the negotiation, or while the treaty was under consideration,
the Government of the United States would protect
the territory to be transferred. I have seen that impossible
pretension put forth in newspapers. I call it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
“impossible.” It is unfounded in the Law of Nations.
Our ships, during the negotiation of the treaty and during
its consideration in the Senate, had no more right
or power in those waters than before the negotiation.
Only when the treaty was consummated by the act of
the Senate giving to it advice and consent, could we
exercise any semblance of jurisdiction there. Every
effort at jurisdiction until that time was usurpation. I
read now from Wheaton’s authoritative work on International
Law, page 337,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> being part of the section entitled,
“The treaty-making power dependent on the municipal
constitution”:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In certain limited or constitutional monarchies the consent
of the legislative power of the nation is in some cases
required for that purpose. In some republics, as in that of
the United States of America, the advice and consent of the
Senate are essential, to enable the chief executive magistrate
to pledge the national faith in this form. In all these cases
it is consequently an implied condition, in negotiating with
foreign powers, that the treaties concluded by the executive
government shall be subject to ratification in the manner prescribed
by the fundamental laws of the State.”</p>

</div>

<p>The Chief Magistrate can pledge the national faith
only according to the Constitution.</p>

<p>Now I turn to another place in this same authoritative
work, being page 718,<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> and read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A treaty of peace binds the contracting parties from the
time of its signature.”</p>

</div>

<p>Then follows an emphatic note from the very able
commentator, Mr. Dana:&mdash;</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquote">

<p>“It would be more exact to say, ‘from the time at which
the treaty is concluded.’ If the political constitution of a
party to the treaty requires ratification by a body in the State,
the treaty is conditional until so ratified.”</p>

</div>

<p>The treaty, therefore, had no effect until ratified by
the Senate; and I repeat, every attempt at jurisdiction
in those waters was a usurpation and an act of violence;
I think I should not go too far, if I said it was an act
of war. If a commodore leaves his quarter-deck, pulls
ashore, and, with his guns commanding a town, threatens
to blow it down, is not this an act of war?</p>

<p>In Great Britain the exclusive prerogative of making
treaties is in the Crown, and so in most other countries
it is in the Executive; but I need not remind you that
in our country it is otherwise. The exclusive prerogative
here is not in the Executive; it is in the President
by and with the advice and consent of the Senate; and
until that advice and consent have been given he can
exercise no power under that treaty. Those waters
were as sacred as the waters about France or about England.
He might as well have penetrated the ports of
either of those countries and launched his menace there
as have penetrated the waters of this weak power and
launched his menace.</p>

<p>I have called it an act of war,&mdash;war, Sir, made by
the Executive without the consent of Congress. If
Congress had declared war against this feeble republic,
then it would have been the part of the Executive to
carry that declaration into effect; but until then what
right had our Executive to do this thing? None which
can be vindicated by the laws of our country, none except
what is found in the law of force.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span></p>
<p>This outrage by our Navy upon a sister republic is
aggravated by the issue which the President of the
United States in his Annual Message has directly made
with the President of Hayti. Of course, Sir, the President
of the United States, when he prepared his Message,
was familiar with a document like that which I
now hold in my hands, entitled “The Monitor, Official
Journal of the Republic of Hayti,” under date of Saturday,
the 24th of September, 1870, containing the
message of the President of Hayti addressed to the
National Assembly. This message is divided into sections
or chapters, with headings, not unlike a message
or document in our own country. And now, Sir, listen
to what the President of Hayti in this annual message
says of the project of annexion, and then in one moment
listen to the issue which the President of the
United States has joined with this President: I translate
it literally:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The project of annexion of the Dominican part has been
rejected by the American Senate. The anxieties which this
annexion caused to spring up have been dissipated before the
good sense and the wisdom of the Senate at Washington.”</p>

</div>

<p>Of course the President of the United States was intimate
with this document. He could not have undertaken
to hurl his bolt against this feeble republic without
knowing at least what its President had said. I
will not do him the wrong to suppose him ignorant.
His Secretary of State must have informed him. He
must have known the precise words that President Saget
had employed, when he said that the anxieties caused
by this annexion were dissipated before the good sense
and wisdom of the Senate at Washington. Our Presid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>ent
joins issue with President Saget; he says that the
rejection of the treaty was a “folly.” There you have
it. The President of the Black Republic calls the rejection
an act of “good sense” and “wisdom”; the President
of the United States calls it an act of “folly.” Am
I wrong? Let me read from the Message of our President:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A large commercial city will spring up, to which we will
be tributary without receiving corresponding benefits, and
then will be seen the folly of our rejecting so great a
prize.”</p>

</div>

<p>So the two stand, President Saget and President
Grant,&mdash;President Grant speaking with the voice of
forty millions, and this other President, who has less
than six hundred thousand people, all black.</p>

<p>If the President of the United States had contented
himself with thus joining issue with the President of
Hayti, I should have left the two face to face; but, not
content with making this issue, the President of the
United States proceeds to menace the independence of
Hayti. Sir, the case is serious. Acting in the spirit of
his commodore, he nine times over makes this menace.
I have the Message here, and now I substantiate what
I say. The part relating to this subject begins,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“During the last session of Congress a treaty for the annexation
of the Republic of San Domingo to the United
States failed to receive the requisite two-thirds vote of the
Senate.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here he speaks of the rejection of the treaty for the
annexion of Dominica, calling it “the Republic of San
Domingo.” This is distinctive. Then he proceeds to
demand the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span> annexion of the whole island. I read as
follows:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I now firmly believe, that, the moment it is known that
the United States have entirely abandoned the project of accepting
as a part of its territory <em>the island of San Domingo</em>,
a free port will be negotiated for by European nations in the
Bay of Samana.”</p>

</div>

<p>I say nothing of the latter part of the proposition;
I leave that to the judgment of the Senate; but here
you have a proposition for the whole island of San Domingo.
The Senate have rejected a treaty for the annexion
of the Republic of San Domingo.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton.</span> Mr. President,&mdash;&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The Senator will not interrupt me
now. I shall finish this statement presently, and then
he may interrupt me.&mdash;Having thus laid down his
basis proposing the annexion of the whole island, which
is called by the geographers sometimes Hayti and sometimes
San Domingo, the President then proceeds to his
second menace:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The acquisition of San Domingo is desirable because of
its geographical position.”</p>

</div>

<p>He has already described it as “the island of San Domingo,”
and it is desirable because of its geographical
position,&mdash;an argument as applicable to Hayti as to
Dominica.</p>

<p>Then he proceeds to the third:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“San Domingo, with a stable government, under which her
immense resources can be developed, will give remunerative
wages to tens of thousands of laborers <em>not now upon the island</em>.”</p>

</div>

<p>Mark the words, “not now u<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>pon <em>the island</em>.” It is
the island always in view.</p>

<p>Then comes the fourth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“San Domingo will become a large consumer of the products
of Northern farms and manufactories.”</p>

</div>

<p>It is the whole island.</p>

<p>Then the fifth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The acquisition of San Domingo is an adherence to the
Monroe Doctrine.”</p>

</div>

<p>Though nothing in this place is said of the whole
island, of course those words are necessarily associated
with the previous words, while the argument from the
Monroe Doctrine is just as applicable to Hayti as to
Dominica.</p>

<p>Then the sixth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“In view of the importance of this question, I earnestly
urge upon Congress early action expressive of its views as to
the best means of acquiring San Domingo.”</p>

</div>

<p>Referring back, of course, to what he has already said.</p>

<p>Then he proposes,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“A commission to negotiate a treaty with the authorities
of San Domingo <em>for the acquisition of that island</em>, and that
an appropriation be made to defray the expenses of such commission.”</p>

</div>

<p>Here is the proposition undisguised.</p>

<p>And he winds up with the ninth:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“So convinced am I of the advantages to flow from the
acquisition of San Domingo,” &amp;c.</p>

</div>

<p>Thus nine times&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p><div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton</span> rose.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> Not quite yet. The Senator will take
notice when I have done with this point, and then he
shall have the floor.&mdash;Nine times in this Message has
the President, after joining issue first with the President
of Hayti,&mdash;nine times has he menaced the independence
of the Haytian Republic. Some remarkable propositions
at times are received with nine cheers. Here
is a menace nine times over; and throughout the whole
of that San Domingo column, written with so much intensity,
we are called to consider commercial, financial,
material advantages, and not one word is lisped of justice
or humanity, not one word of what we owe to the
neighboring Republic of Hayti, nine times menaced.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Morton</span> rose.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> I know what my friend from Indiana
is about to say,&mdash;that all this is accidental. This is
hard to believe. Nine accidents in one column! Nine
accidents of menace against a sister republic! There
is a maxim of law, which I was taught early and have
not entirely forgotten, that we are bound to presume
that every document is executed solemnly and in conformity
with rule. Sir, we are bound to believe that
the President’s Message was carefully considered. There
can be no accident in a President’s Message. A President’s
Message is not a stump speech. It is not a Senate
speech. It is a document, every line of which must
have been carefully considered, not only by the President
himself, but by every member of his Cabinet.</p>

<p>There are Senators here who have been familiar with
Messages in other years, and know how they are prepared.
I have one in my mind which within my knowledge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
occupied the consideration of the Cabinet three
full days,&mdash;I think four, if not five,&mdash;every single sentence
being carefully considered, read by itself, revised,
sounded with the hammer, if I may so express myself,
like the wheels of a railroad car, to see that it had the
true ring. Of course the Message of a President of the
United States must go through such an examination. I
will not follow the Senator from Indiana in doing the
injustice to the President of supposing that his Message
was ill-considered, that it was not carefully read over
with his Cabinet, that every sentence was not debated,
and that these words were not all finally adopted as expressing
the sentiments of the President. At any rate,
there they stand in the Message. Now any word in a
Message, as in a Queen’s Speech, even loosely or inconsiderately
proposing anything adverse to the independence
of a country, is in the nature of a menace. My
language is not too strong. In such a case a word is a
blow.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>History is often said to repeat itself. More or less it
does. It repeats itself now. This whole measure of
annexion, and the spirit with which it is pressed, find a
parallel in the Kansas and Nebraska Bill, and in the
Lecompton Constitution, by which it was sought to subjugate
a distant Territory to Slavery. The Senator from
Indiana was not here during those days, although he
was acting well his part at home; but he will remember
the pressure to which we were then exposed. And
now we witness the same things: violence in a distant
island, as there was violence in Kansas; also the same
Presidential appliances; and shall I add, the same menace
of personal assault filling the air? All this naturally<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
flowers in the Presidential proposition that the annexion
shall be by joint resolution of the two Houses of
Congress; so that we have violence to Dominica, violence
to Hayti, violence to Public Law, including violence
to the Constitution of Dominica, and also to a
Treaty between Dominica and Hayti, crowned by violence
to the Constitution of the United States.</p>

<p>In other days, to carry his project, a President tried
to change a committee. It was James Buchanan.<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> And
now we have been called this session to witness a similar
endeavor by our President. He was not satisfied
with the Committee on Foreign Relations as constituted
for years. He wished a change. He asked first for the
removal of the Chairman. Somebody told him that
this would not be convenient. He then asked for the
removal of the Senator from Missouri [Mr. <span class="smcap">Schurz</span>];
and he was told that this could not be done without affecting
the German vote. He then called for the removal
of my friend the Senator from New Hampshire,
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Patterson</span>,] who unhappily had no German votes
behind him. It was finally settled that this could not
be done.</p>

<p>I allude to these things reluctantly, and only as part
of the case. They illustrate the spirit we are called to
encounter. They illustrate the extent to which the
President has fallen into the line of bad examples.</p>

<p>Sir, I appeal to you, as Vice-President. By official
position and by well-known relations of friendship you
enjoy opportunities which I entreat you to use for the
good of your country, and, may I add, for the benefit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span> of
that party which has so justly honored you. Go to the
President, I ask you, and address him frankly with the
voice of a friend to whom he must hearken. Counsel
him to shun all approach to the example of Franklin
Pierce, James Buchanan, and Andrew Johnson; tell
him not to allow the oppression of a weak and humble
people; ask him not to exercise War Powers without
authority of Congress; and remind him, kindly, but
firmly, that there is a grandeur in Justice and Peace
beyond anything in material aggrandizement, beyond
anything in war.</p>

<p>Again I return to the pending resolution, which I
oppose as a new stage in the long-drawn machination.
Am I wrong in holding up this negotiation, which has
in it so much of violence,&mdash;violence toward Dominica,
violence toward Hayti? Of course the proposed treaty
assumes and adopts the civil war pending in the territory
annexed. This is the terrible incumbrance. No
prudent man buys a lawsuit; but we are called to buy
a bloody lawsuit. I read now the recent testimony of
Mr. Hatch, who, while in favor of annexion, writes as
follows, under date of South Norwalk, Connecticut, December
12, 1870:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“I have not, however, looked with favor upon the project
as it has been attempted to be effected; and I firmly believe,
if we should receive that territory from the hands of President
Baez, while all the leading men of the Cabral party, the
most numerous, the most intelligent, and the wealthiest, are
in prison, in exile, or in arms against Baez, without their
having a voice in the transfer, it would result in a terrible
disaster.”</p>

</div>

<p>Be taught by the experience of Spain, when in 1861
this power, on the invitation of a predecessor of Baez<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>,
undertook to play the part we are asked to play. Forts
were built and troops were landed. By a document
which I now hold in my hand it appears, that, when at
last this power withdrew, she had expended forty millions
of hard Spanish dollars and “sacrificed sixteen
thousand of the flower of her army.” From another
source I learn that ten thousand Spanish soldiers were
buried there. Are we ready to enter upon this bloody
dance? Are we ready to take up this bloody lawsuit?</p>

<p>Vain to set forth, as the Message does, all manner of
advantages, “commercially and materially.” What are
these, if Right and Humanity are sacrificed? What
are these without that priceless blessing, Peace? I am
not insensible to the commercial and material prosperity
of my country. But there is something above these.
It is the honor and good name of the Republic, now
darkened by an act of wrong. If this territory, so much
coveted by the President, were infinitely more valuable
than it is, I hope the Senate would not be tempted to
obtain it by trampling on the weak and humble. Admit
all that the advocates of the present scheme assert
with regard to the resources of this territory, and then
imagine its lofty mountains bursting with the precious
metals, its streams flowing with amber over silver sands,
where every field is a Garden of the Hesperides, blooming
with vegetable gold, and all this is not worth the
price we are called to pay.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There is one other consideration, vast in importance
and conclusive in character, to which I allude only.
The island of San Domingo, situated in tropical waters,
and occupied by another race, of another color, never
can become a permanent possession of the United St<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>ates.
You may seize it by force of arms or by diplomacy,
where a naval squadron does more than the minister;
but the enforced jurisdiction cannot endure. Already
by a higher statute is that island set apart to the colored
race. It is theirs by right of possession, by their
sweat and blood mingling with the soil, by tropical position,
by its burning sun, and by unalterable laws of
climate. Such is the ordinance of Nature, which I am
not the first to recognize. San Domingo is the earliest
of that independent group destined to occupy the Caribbean
Sea, toward which our duty is plain as the Ten
Commandments. Kindness, beneficence, assistance, aid,
help, protection, all that is implied in good neighborhood,&mdash;these
we must give, freely, bountifully; but
their independence is as precious to them as is ours to
us, and it is placed under the safeguard of natural laws
which we cannot violate with impunity.</p>

<p>Long ago it was evident that the Great Republic
might fitly extend the shelter of its protection to the
governments formed in these tropical islands, dealing
with them graciously, generously, and in a Christian
spirit,&mdash;helping them in their weakness, encouraging
them in their trials, and being to them always a friend;
but we take counsel of our supposed interests rather
than theirs, when we seek to remove them from the
sphere in which they have been placed by Providence.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>I conclude as I began. I protest against this legislation
as another stage in a drama of blood. I protest
against it in the name of Justice outraged by violence,
in the name of Humanity insulted, in the name of the
weak trodden down, in the name of Peace imperilled,
and in the name of the African race<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>, whose first effort
at Independence is rudely assailed.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p>Later in debate Mr. Sumner spoke in reply as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>,&mdash;So far as the Senator from Michigan
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Chandler</span>] arraigns me as a member of the
Republican party I have no reply. He knows that I
am as good a Republican as himself; he knows that I
have had as much to do with the making and support
of the party as himself; and when <span class="smcap">Charles Sumner</span>
finds the Senators over the way ranging under his
banner, as the Senator predicts, this country will be
regenerated,&mdash;for the Democratic party will be Republican.</p>

<p>But I do reply to the questions of fact. And now,
Sir, I am obliged to make a statement&mdash;the Senator
compels me&mdash;which I had hoped not to make. The
President of the United States did me the honor to call
at my house,&mdash;it was nearly a year ago, during the recess.
Shortly after coming into the room he alluded to
certain new treaties already negotiated, with regard to
which I had no information. Sir, you must expect me
to speak frankly. The President addressed me four
times as Chairman of the Judiciary Committee,&mdash;adding,
that the treaties would come before the Judiciary
Committee, and on this account he wished to speak
with me.</p>

<p>He proceeded with an explanation, which I very soon
interrupted, saying: “By the way, Mr. President, it is
very hard to turn out Governor Ashley; I have just received
a letter from the Governor, and I hope I shall
not take too great a liberty, Mr. President, if I read it.
I find it excellent and eloquent, and written with a feeling
which interests me much.” I commenced the letter
and read two pages or more, when I thought the P<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Pg 294]</a></span>resident
was uneasy, and I felt that perhaps I was taking
too great a liberty with him in my own house; but I
was irresistibly impelled by loyalty to an absent friend,
while I was glad of this opportunity of diverting attention
from the treaties. As conversation about Governor
Ashley subsided the President returned to the treaties,
leaving on my mind no very strong idea of what they
proposed, and absolutely nothing with regard to the
character of the negotiation. My reply was precise.
The language is fixed absolutely in my memory. “Mr.
President,” I said, “I am an Administration man, and
whatever you do will always find in me the most careful
and candid consideration.” Those were my words.</p>

<p>I have heard it said that I assured the President that
I would support his Administration in this measure.
Never! He may have formed this opinion, but never
did I say anything to justify it; nor did I suppose he
could have failed to appreciate the reserve with which
I spoke. My language, I repeat, was precise, well-considered,
and chosen in advance: “I am an Administration
man, and whatever you do will always find in me
the most careful and candid consideration.” In this
statement I am positive. It was early fixed in my
mind, and I know that I am right.</p>

<p>And, Sir, did I not give to the treaties the most careful
and candid consideration? They were referred to
the committee with which I am connected. I appeal
to my colleagues on that committee if I did not do all
that I promised. When I first laid them before the
committee, it was very evident that there was a large
majority against them. Indeed, there was only one
member of the committee who said anything in their
favor. I then stated that I hoped our conversation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
would be regarded as informal, and that there would be
no immediate vote, or any course which could be interpreted
otherwise than friendly to the Administration.
Too prompt action might be misconstrued.</p>

<p>My desire was to proceed with utmost delicacy. I
did not know then, what I have learned since, how the
President had set his heart upon the project of annexion.
With my experience of treaties, familiar as I have
been with them in the Senate, I supposed that I was
pursuing the course most agreeable to him, and, should
the report be adverse, most respectful and considerate.
This I state, Sir, on my conscience, as my solemn judgment
at the time, and my motive of conduct. I wished
to be careful and candid. It was easy to see from the
beginning that annexion had small chance in the committee,
whatever might be its fate in the Senate; but I
was determined to say and do nothing by which the
result should in any way be aggravated. Again I appeal
to every one of my colleagues on that committee
for their testimony in this behalf. I know that I am
above criticism. I know that I have pursued a patriotic
course, always just and considerate to the President;
and I tell the Senator from Michigan, who has served
with me so long in this Chamber, that he does me great
injustice. Some time or other he will see it so. He
may not see it now; but he ought to rise in his place
and at once correct the wrong.</p>

<p>Perhaps I need not say more, and yet there has been
so much criticism upon me to-night that I proceed a little
further. Here was my friend at my right, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>,]
who, having shot his shaft, has left. I wish that he had
praised me less and been more candid. His praise
was generous, but his candor certainly less marked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
than his praise. I might take up every point of his
speech and show you the wrong that he did me. He is
not in his seat. I wish he were. [<i>Mr. Nye entered the
Chamber from one of the cloak-rooms.</i>] Oh, there he
comes. He said that I was against inquiry. No such
thing. I am for inquiry. I wish all the documents
now on the files of the State Department and of the
Navy Department spread before Congress and before
the country. To this end I have introduced a resolution
which is now on your table; I wish this information
before any other step is taken in this business.
Instead of being against inquiry, I am for it, and in that
way which will be most effective. But the resolution
which I introduced, asking for the most important testimony,
all documentary in character, is left on the table,
while a different proposition, legislative in character and
in no respect a resolution of inquiry, but an act creating
three new officers under the Constitution, is pressed
on the Senate, and, as I demonstrated to-day, for the obvious
purpose of associating Congress with this scheme
of annexion. The whole question of annexion was
opened, and I felt it my duty to show at what cost to
the good name of this Republic the scheme has been
pursued down to this day. I entered upon this exposure
with a reluctance which I cannot express; but it
was with me a duty.</p>

<p>My friend at my right [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>] says&mdash;I took down
his words, I think&mdash;that I saw nothing in the President’s
Message except what he said about San Domingo.
I was speaking of San Domingo, and not of the other
topics; nor was I speaking of the President. There
again my friend did me injustice. I was speaking of
annexion; and it is my habit, I think you will do me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
the justice to say, Mr. President, to speak directly to
the questions on which I undertake to address the Senate.
At any rate, I try to confine myself to the point;
and the point to-day was annexion, and nothing else.
I was not called to go to the right or to the left, to enter
upon all the various topics of the Message, whether for
praise or censure. The Message was not under discussion,
except in one single point. Nor was I considering
the merits of the Administration, or the merits, whether
civil or military, of the President, but the annexion of
San Domingo, on which I felt it my duty to express
myself with the freedom which belongs to a Senator of
the United States.</p>

<p>The Senator here [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>] says, and the Senator
over the way, [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>,] I think, said the same
thing, that I have assailed the President. I have done
no such thing. I alluded to the President as little as
possible, and never except in strict subordination to the
main question. On this question of annexion I feel
strongly,&mdash;not as the Senator [Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>] has most uncandidly
suggested, from any pride of opinion, or because
I have already expressed myself one way and the
President another, but because for long years I have felt
strongly always when human rights were assailed. I
cannot see the humble crushed without my best endeavor
against the wrong. Long ago I read those proud
words by which Rome in her glory was described as
making it her business to spare the humble, but to war
down the proud.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> I felt that we had before us a case
where the rule was reversed, and in an unhappy hour
our Government was warring down the humble. So it
seemed to me on the evidence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[Pg 298]</a></span></p>
<p>Do I err? Then set the facts before the people, that
they may judge; but, as I understand those facts,
whether from official documents or from the testimony
of officers or citizens who have been in that island latterly,
Baez has been maintained in power by the arms
of the United States. So I understand it. Correct me,
if I am wrong; but if the facts be as I believe, you
must leave me to my judgment upon them.</p>

<p>Both my honorable friends, the Senator on my right
[Mr. <span class="smcap">Nye</span>] and the Senator over the way [Mr. <span class="smcap">Morton</span>],
have said that I sought to present an unfavorable comparison
between the President of Hayti and the President
of the United States; and the Senator over the
way went into an elaborate arraignment of the Haytian
President. Sir, I had no word of praise for that President.
The Senator is mistaken. From his Message,
which I now hold in my hand, I read his congratulation
that the project of annexion had been defeated by
“the good sense and the wisdom” of the Senate at
Washington; and I then read from the Message of the
President of the United States what I supposed was the
issue he intended to join with the Haytian President,
characterizing this very rejection of annexion on the
part of the Senate as “folly”; and I put the two Messages
on that point face to face, and there I left them.
I said nothing to praise Saget or to arraign Grant. Sir,
I have no disposition to do either. I only wish to do
my duty simply and humbly, pained and sorry that I
am called to differ from so many valued friends, but
then still feeling that for me there is no other course
to pursue.</p>

<div class="medium">

<h2><a name="NEW_YEARS_DAY" id="NEW_YEARS_DAY"></a>NEW YEAR’S DAY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Article in the New York Independent,
January 5, 1871.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="dropcap">The Old Year is dead. Hail to the New! How
alike! How unlike! Each is a measure of
time,&mdash;the Old belonging to the infinite Past, the New
to the infinite Future. But each has its own trials and
its own triumphs. Be it our aspiration to smooth the
trials and assure the triumphs before us!</p>

<p>Sorrow and grief there must be. May they be tempered
with mercy, and may we bear them with submission!
Work and effort there must be; for such is the
condition of life. And then there is Duty always,
which we are justly told is “more than life.” What
is life where duty fails? Companion with all is Hope,
with too flickering sunshine. All these will be surely
ours in the New Year, as they were during the year
that has passed.</p>

<p>Looking beyond the microcosm of individual life to
the macrocosm of the world, other trials and triumphs
are before us. God grant that the triumphs may surpass
the trials, making the New Year an epoch in human
progress!</p>

<p>Unhappily, we are not yet relieved from anxiety on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span>
account of the Rebellion. Though Reconstruction is in
our statute-book, it is not yet established in the universal
heart of the Nation, as it must be before peace can
be permanently assured. There are painful reports from
States lately in rebellion, showing that life is unsafe and
society disorganized. North Carolina is always considered
less mercurial and violent than her Southern
neighbor, with whom the Rebellion began; but this
slow and staid State is now disturbed by bad spirits,
menacing revolution and blood. A private letter says:
“I am assured, by men who know, that blood will be
spilt, if Congress does not interfere. The excitement
of ’61 bore no comparison to this.” In certain counties
the Ku-Klux-Klan so far dominates that to be a Unionist
is to brave death. Nor is this evil spirit confined to
North Carolina. It shows itself in other States, and
threatens to extend. Alas, that, after all the terrible
sacrifices of these latter days, we should be called to
this new experience!</p>

<p>And yet the Rebellion is said to be suppressed. This
is a mistake. So long as men are in peril whose only
offence is that they love the Nation, or that their skins
are not “white,” the Rebellion still exists. Force is
needed; nor is this the time to remove political disabilities.
Our first obligation is to those who stood by the
Nation, and those others whom the Nation has rescued
from bondage. These two classes must be protected at
all hazards. Here is a sacred duty. And not until this
is completely performed can we listen to the talk of
Amnesty.</p>

<p>Amnesty! Tempting and most persuasive word!
Who would not be glad to accord it? Who would not
delight to behold all in equal citizenship? But the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span>
general safety is the supreme law. The people must be
secure in their homes; especially must the Unionist and
the Freedman be safe against all assault, while dear-bought
rights are fixed beyond recall. When this is
done, how happy will all be to remove every bar and
ban! Nought in vengeance, nought even in punishment;
but all for the sake of that peace which is the
first condition of national welfare.</p>

<p>If Reconstruction and Amnesty perplex us still, it
is because we did not begin to deal with them sooner.
Promptly on the surrender of Lee the just system
should have been declared,&mdash;being Reconstruction on
the principles of the Declaration of Independence, with
a piece of land for every adult freedman, to be followed
by Amnesty and Reconciliation. Our present embarrassments
proceed from failure to comprehend the case,
or from perverse sympathy with Rebels,&mdash;all of which
we inherit from the misrule of Andrew Johnson. It is
for us to apply the corrective. Too late it may be for
the piece of land; but it is not too late for the vigorous
enforcement of Reconstruction, involving necessarily
the adjournment of Amnesty.</p>

<p>Specie Payments should accompany the completion
of Reconstruction. Both have lingered too long. Not
only did we err at the surrender of Lee in postponing
Reconstruction, but also in postponing all effort for
Specie Payments. The time has come for the consummation
of each. May the year we now greet witness
these two triumphs! Peace and security are the specie
of Reconstruction, as gold and silver are the specie of
Currency. We must have both.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>It is hard that these questions should now be c<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span>omplicated
with a machination to annex a West India island
by violence, and without any popular voice in its favor.
Ships of the National Navy uphold an unprincipled pretender,
thus enabled to sell his country. This is violence,
as much as if a broadside were fired. It is according
to the worst precedents. To this crushing fact
add an unknown expenditure from the cost of our navy
engaged in enforcing the capitulation; also the debt to
be assumed, the money to be paid down; and then the
climax of war on a tropical island where already Frenchmen
and Spaniards have succumbed. The whole story
is painful, and forms a melancholy chapter of the national
history. At a moment when there should be
unity among good men for the sake of peace, it is
strange and incomprehensible that this project should
be pressed for adoption. Better far bestow our energies
in the guardianship of Reconstruction and the establishment
of civil order within our borders, including specie
payments.</p>

<p>This attempt is aggravated, when it is considered how
it proceeds in grievous indifference to the African race.
Not content with setting up an adventurer in Dominica,
it menaces the Republic of Hayti. An American Commodore
was found who did not resign rather than do
this thing. What are fairest fields with golden harvests
as compensation for such an act? But, if indifferent to
the means of annexion, and content even with violence,
there remains another question, overtopping all others:
Whether the whole Island of San Domingo is not set
apart by Providence for the African race?&mdash;nay, more,
Whether the whole Caribbean Sea must not be African?
A private letter fro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Pg 304]</a></span>m New Jersey gives expression to
humane sentiments:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“As a great people, instead of swallowing up small republics,
we should encourage their growth, and, above all, leave
a small portion at least where the African and his descendants
may work out the problem of self-government.…
I speak to you in behalf of the colored Sabbath School of
this city, numbering one hundred and eighty-one members,
from seven years of age up to ninety-five,&mdash;I speak in behalf
of our colored citizens, (we are all agreed upon it,)&mdash;I
speak in behalf of myself, a sufferer and a laborer amongst
them for ten years past, when I say we are <em>all opposed</em> to the
annexation of San Domingo.”</p>

</div>

<p>This is natural. It is not easy to comprehend how
it can be otherwise. Colored persons, unwilling to see
their race sacrificed, will make a stand against an ill-omened
measure. New Year’s Day will be elevated by
vows to keep our Republic true to her great mission, as
benefactor, rather than conquering annexer.</p>

<p>Not without anxiety can we see how, contrary to the
promise of his Inaugural, the President proclaims a “policy,”
and insists upon its enforcement, even to the extent
of disregarding the treaty power of the Senate, and
menacing annexion of a foreign nation by Joint Resolution.
Is Congress to be coerced? All this may make
us reflect with more than usual solemnity at the beginning
of a New Year.</p>

<p>Such an effort is adverse to the Republican Party,
with which are associated the best interests of the
country. Every Republican must do his best to keep
the party strong. Questions calculated to divide must
not be pressed. The party must be a unit; but it cannot
be such at any mere word of command. No one
man by <i>ipse dixit</i> can establish the test of fidel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Pg 305]</a></span>ity to the
party. Its strength is in its principles, and especially
in the Declaration of Independence, which is its corner-stone.
Let us stand by these, without any new shibboleth,
unknown to the party, and which many can never
utter. General Jackson’s great words for the Union
should be adopted now: “The Republican Party; <em>it
must be preserved!</em>” And may every project inconsistent
with its harmony be allowed to slumber! This is
a fit vow for the New Year.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>On this day the thoughts cannot be confined to our
own country. Wherever man exists, there must our
good wishes travel, with the precious example of our
Republic, making Liberty everywhere an inspiration.
To the whole human family must the benison go,&mdash;adding
especially that most precious of all, the benison
of Peace. Humanity stands aghast at the barbarous
conflict yet prolonged between two most civilized nations.
Who can gauge the mighty dimensions of the
fearful sacrifice? Soon must it end, and out of its consuming
fires may a new civilization arise! The time
has come when the War System, which is still the established
arbiter for the determination of international
differences, must give place to peaceful substitutes and
the disarming of nations. Let this be done, and there
will be a triumph with glory serene and lasting, undimmed
by a single tear. Forbear, at least on this day
of aspiration, to insist that such a good cannot be accomplished.
You wrong Human Nature, when you
proclaim that the colossal barbarism bestriding nations
must be maintained. You wrong Justice, when you degrade
it to the condition of successful force, making
<em>Might</em> the substitute and synonym for <em>Right</em>. You<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Pg 306]</a></span>
wrong Charity, with all the virtues in her train, when
you put them under the hoof of Violence. International
War, like Slavery, is a monster chartered by Law.
Why not repeal the charter? That this may be done is
another vow worthy of the year we begin.</p>

<h2><a name="ITALIAN_UNITY" id="ITALIAN_UNITY"></a>ITALIAN UNITY.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Letter to a Public Meeting at the Academy of Music
in New York, January 10, 1871.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="right medium"><span class="smcap">Senate Chamber</span>, January 10, 1871.</p>

<p class="dropcap">DEAR SIR,&mdash;Though not in person at your great
meeting to commemorate what you happily call
the completion of Italian unity, I shall be there in heart
and soul. A lover of Italy and anxious for her independence
as a nation, I have for years longed to see this
day. Italy without Rome was like the body without its
head. Rome is the natural head of Italy, and is now
at last joined with the body to which it belongs, never
again to be separated.</p>

<p>How many hearts have throbbed with alternate despair
and hope, watching the too tardy fulfilment of the
patriot aspiration for that United Italy which shall possess
once more the Capitoline Hill and the ancient Forum,
the Colosseum and its immense memories of grandeur,
together with the later dome of Michel Angelo, in
itself the emblem of all-embracing unity! This was
the aspiration of Cavour. I remember the great man
well, at the very beginning of the war for Independence,
in a small apartment which was bed-room and office,
while he conversed on the future of the historic <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Pg 308]</a></span>Peninsula,
and with tranquil voice declared that all must be
free to the Adriatic, with Rome as the national capital.
I need not say that I listened with delight and sympathy.
He died before all was free to the Adriatic, and
while Rome was yet ruled by the Papal autocrat. At
last his desires are accomplished. Naturally the liberation
of Venice was followed by the liberation of Rome,
and both, when free, helped complete the national unity.
No longer “merely a geographical expression,” according
to the insulting phrase of Metternich, Italy is now
a nation whose lofty capstone is Rome.</p>

<p>Besides the triumph of the nation, I see in this event
two other things of surpassing value in the history of
Liberty. First, the union of Church and State is overthrown
in its greatest example. The Pope remains the
pastor of a mighty flock, but without temporal power.
Here is a precedent, which, beginning at Rome, must be
followed everywhere, until Church and State are no
longer conjoined, and all are at liberty to worship God
according to conscience, without compulsion from Man.
The other consequence is hardly less important. The
Pope was an absolute sovereign for life. In the overthrow
of his temporal power Absolutism receives a
blow, and the people everywhere obtain new assurance
for the future. Here is occasion for joy and hope.
There is no Italian who may not now repeat the words
of Alfieri without dooming himself to exile:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Loco, ove solo <span class="smcap">un</span> contra tutti basta,</div>

</div>
</div>

<p>The poet who loved Liberty so well was right, when
he refused to recognize as his country that place “where
<em>one alone</em> sufficed against all.” But this was the condition
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Pg 309]</a></span>of Rome under the Papal power.</p>

<p>Therefore, not only in sympathy with Italy, but in
devotion to human rights, do I rejoice in this day.</p>

<p>Full of good wishes for Italy, happy in what she has
already accomplished, and hopeful for the future, I remain,
dear Sir, very faithfully yours,</p>

<h2><a name="RESPONSE_TO_A_TOAST" id="RESPONSE_TO_A_TOAST"></a>RESPONSE TO A TOAST.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Remarks at a Complimentary Dinner to Colonel John
W. Forney, at Washington, January 28, 1871.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>The occasion was one of farewell to Colonel Forney by his brother
journalists, on his retirement from the editorship of the “Chronicle”
and removal from Washington,&mdash;Mr. Sumner being one of a few invited
guests.</p>

<p>After the toast to Colonel Forney, and his response, Mr. L. A. Gobright,
of the Associated Press, at the call of the Chair rose and
said:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“<span class="smcap">Gentlemen</span>,&mdash;The glory of a free people is the possession of a government
founded upon justice. It is their duty at all times to defend it against
assaults from without and the causes of ruin within. Education is an essential
principle with a view to the elevation of morals. The political superstructure
being a social necessity, controversies as to the architecture and
materials to be employed only excite comment, and thus quicken the interest
in the great results. The people, however, select the workmen: Congress
to make the laws; the Judiciary to expound them; the President to
administer them; and the Press to record them with comments, either of
censure or favorable, as the public interests may demand. We have heard
from the Press; it is but just that we should now hear from Congress,&mdash;from
one who is a native and a resident of a part of the country the people
of which have long been familiar with the subject of Constitutions for the
purpose of securing religious and political freedom. I therefore, in the
name of this Society and at the command of our President, respectfully
call upon the Hon. Charles Sumner to respond to&mdash;</p>

<p>“‘The Government of the United States: The Press records with pride
the acts of the executive and legislative branches to secure the honor of the
nation abroad and its prosperity at home.’”</p>

</div>

<p>Mr<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Pg 311]</a></span>. Sumner, responding, said:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">Really, Mr. President, when I listened to the remarks
of our excellent Mr. Gobright upon Education,
Architecture, and various other important topics,
I could not see how he could land on me. [<i>Laughter.</i>]
By what process I am to-night in that line is past my
comprehension. I am still further mystified when
called to respond for the Government. [<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>Mr. President, do I represent the Government?
[<i>Laughter and applause.</i>] I wish I did, but I fear
that I do not. I do represent Massachusetts,&mdash;[“<i>That’s
so!</i>”]&mdash;the venerable Commonwealth who gives me
permission to speak for her. And yet, as I am called
to speak of the Government, I am reminded of an incident
which may not be familiar to all, as I do not
remember to have seen it in print, of what occurred
to Joseph Bonaparte, when, after the overthrow of his
family, leaving France, he sought a home on this side of
the ocean, and reaching New York, he looked about for
a soldier or <i>gendarme</i>, or at least a policeman, to whom
he could exhibit his passport. There was none within
sight or call, when, at last, he exclaimed: “This is
the first country where I ever found myself in which
I could not find the Government.” I believe that you
are not more fortunate to-night, when you call upon me
to speak for the Government, than was Joseph Bonaparte,
ex-King of Spain, when he landed in New York.
[<i>Laughter and applause.</i>] We are of course talking
confidentially here,&mdash;[“<i>Oh, yes, of course!</i>”]&mdash;and yet,
if you will allow me to allude to the Government, I
will say that I do wish this Government of ours may
be so good and great, so true and brave, that i<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span>t may become
an example of republican institutions, by which
they may be commended throughout the world. [<i>Applause.</i>]
I am a believer in republican institutions, and
I do earnestly wish that my country should be a most
persuasive example.</p>

<p>But you are thinking more of your guest than of the
Government, and, however I may be addressed, I am
only a witness here to-night. I witness the honors bestowed
and received. The two parties are the gentlemen
of the press in Washington, of the first part, and
my honored friend, John W. Forney, of the second part.
[<i>Applause.</i>] The rest are witnesses only.</p>

<p>If a witness might speak, I would declare the pleasure
I feel in this instance of fellowship and harmony,
as honorable to the many hosts as to the single guest.
Such an example will do something to smooth those differences
which, unhappily, are too often the incident of
public life. And yet this token is natural. Are we not
told that we shall reap as we have sown? And has not
your guest sown always the seeds of kindness and goodwill?
[<i>Applause, and cries of “That’s so!”</i>] And,
therefore, should he not now reap his reward? My
own friendly relations began when there were many
differences between us; but I remember continually
the personal amenity, superior to all differences, by
which I was won to him.</p>

<p>In leaving Washington, he goes from one circle of
friends to another circle, of which we have honored representatives
here to-night. I cannot wish for him more
than that he may be as happy and welcome with them
as he has been with you.</p>

<p>Our guest, only a moment ago, in conversation alluded
to this Saturday evening, which so peculiarly <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span>belongs
to gentlemen of the Press, as reminding of the
“Cotter’s Saturday Night,” the exquisite poem of Burns.
He will allow me to quote words peculiarly applicable:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“The toil-worn cotter frae his labor goes;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">This night his weekly moil is at an end;</div>
<div class="verse">Collects his spades, his mattocks, and his hoes.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="right">[<i>Laughter.</i>]</p>

<p>Such is your case to-night, unless you are connected
with a Sunday paper. [<i>Laughter.</i>] Your weekly moil
is at an end. Allow me to wish that when it is again
renewed, it may be with heart streng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Pg 314]</a></span>thened and soul refreshed
by the social enjoyment of to-night.</p>

<h2><a name="DUTY_OF_THE_YOUNG_COLORED_LAWYER" id="DUTY_OF_THE_YOUNG_COLORED_LAWYER"></a>DUTY OF THE YOUNG COLORED LAWYER.</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Address at the Commencement Exercises of the Law
Department of Howard University at Washington,
February 3, 1871.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="smcap">Young Gentlemen, Graduates of the Law School</span>:&mdash;</p>

<p class="dropcap">I am glad in listening to the exercises on this interesting
occasion. They carry me back to early life,
when I was a student at the Law School of Harvard
University, as you have been students in the Law
School of Howard University. I cannot think of those
days without fondness. They were the happiest of my
life. Nor do I doubt that hereafter you will look back
with something of the same emotion to your student
days.</p>

<p>There is happiness in the acquisition of knowledge,
which surpasses all common joys. The student who
feels that he is making daily progress, constantly learning
something new, who sees the shadows by which he
was originally surrounded gradually exchanged for an
atmosphere of light, cannot fail to be happy. His toil
becomes a delight, and all that he learns is a treasure,&mdash;with
this difference from gold and silver, that it cannot
be stolen or lost. It is a perpetual capital at compound
interest. Therefore do I say, for the sake of happiness,
and also <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span>for worldly good, must the young man be faithful
in study.</p>

<p>Pardon me, if, while congratulating you upon the
career you now commence, I make one or two practical
suggestions, which I hope may not be without value.</p>

<p>In the first place, you must not cease your studies,
now that you leave the Law School. You must be
students always. Some there are who content themselves
with what is called “an education,” and then
cease their studies. This is a mistake. At college or
school we acquire the elements of knowledge, and we
learn also <em>how to study</em>,&mdash;but very little more. If to
this be added the love of study, this is the beginning
of success.</p>

<p>But your studies must not be confined to the Law;
you must study other things. Your minds must be refined
and elevated by Literature; your knowledge must
be extended by Science. All great lawyers testify to
the importance of these acquisitions. Probably most
persons familiar with the law would recognize the venerable
Horace Binney, of Philadelphia, as the living
head of the profession in our country; but while he
was engaged in practice, he was not more remarkable
for profound learning in the Law than for various attainments
in scholarship and science. The necessity of
literature to the lawyer is illustrated by an anecdote of
Lord Brougham, who, when Chancellor of England, was
visited by the father of a young man just commencing
his law studies, and asked what books he would especially
recommend to the beginner. “Tell him to read
Dante,” was the prompt reply. “But,” said the astonished
father, “my son<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span> is beginning law.” “Yes,” said
the Chancellor, “and I say tell him to read Dante. If
he would be a good lawyer, he must be at home in
literature.”</p>

<p>There is one other possession without which science,
literature, and law, all in amplest measure, will be of
small avail: it is Character. Would you succeed, you
must deserve success; and this can only be by character.
Cicero, in his work describing the orator, says that he
must be a good man; that otherwise he cannot be a
true orator.<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> This is heathen testimony worthy of constant
memory. But the same may be said of the lawyer.
Remember well, do not forget, you cannot be a
good lawyer unless you are a good man. Nothing is
more certain.</p>

<p>If to these things be added health, there is no success
which will not be within your reach.</p>

<p>There is one other remark which I hope you will allow
me to make. Belonging to a race which for long
generations has been oppressed and despoiled of rights,
you must be the vigilant and sensitive defenders of all
who suffer in any way from wrong. The good lawyer
should always be on the side of Human Rights; and yet
it is a melancholy fact in history that lawyers have too
often lent learning and subtle tongue to sustain wrong.
This you must scorn to do. In the sacred cause of
Justice be faithful, constant, brave. No matter who is
the offender,&mdash;whether crime be attempted by political
party, by Congress, or by President,&mdash;wherever it shows
itself, whether on the continent or on an island of the
sea, you must be ready at all times to stand forth, careless
of consequences, and vindicate the Right. So doing,
you will uphold your own race in its unexampled
trials.</p>

<p>Each of you is a unit of the mass. Therefore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span> sustaining
the rights of all, you will sustain your own.
Be not satisfied with anything less than the Rights of
All. But while generously maintaining the rights of
others, I venture to say that you will be entirely unworthy
of the vantage-ground on which you now stand,
if you do not insist at all times on those Equal Rights
which are still denied to you. Here particularly is a
duty. The poet has said that</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
<div class="verse">“Who would be free, themselves must strike the blow.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p class="noindent">You are all free, God be praised! But you are still
shut out from rights which are justly yours. Yourselves
must strike the blow,&mdash;not by violence, but in
every mode known to the Constitution and Law. I do
not doubt that every denial of Equal Rights, whether
in the school-room, the jury-box, the public hotel, the
steamboat, or the public conveyance, by land or water,
is contrary to the fundamental principles of Republican
Government, and therefore to the Constitution itself,
which should be corrected by the Courts, if not by
Congress. See to it that this is done. The Constitution
does not contain the word “white”; who can insert it
in the Law? Insist that the common-school, where the
child is prepared for the duties of manhood, shall know
no discrimination unknown to the Constitution. Insist,
also, that the public conveyances and public hotels, owing
their existence to Law, shall know no discrimination
unknown to the Constitution, so that the Senator or
the Representative in Congress, who is the peer of all
at the National Capitol, shall not be insulted and degraded
on the way to his public duties. Insist upon
equal rights everywhere; make others insist upon them.
Insist that our institutions shall be brought into perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span>
harmony with the promises of the Declaration of Independence,
which is grand for its universality. I hold
you to this allegiance,&mdash;first, by the race from which
you are sprung, and, secondly, by the profession you
now espouse.</p>

<h2><a name="CHARITY_TO_FRANCE_OR_GERMANY" id="CHARITY_TO_FRANCE_OR_GERMANY"></a>CHARITY TO FRANCE OR GERMANY?</h2>

<p class="plabeln"><span class="smcap">Speech in the Senate, February 4, 1871.</span></p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/line.png" width="80" height="16" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="medium">

<p>February 4, 1871, Mr. Pomeroy, of Kansas, brought forward a
Joint Resolution authorizing the President “to cause to be stationed
at the port of New York, if the same can be done without injury to
the public service, one or more of our naval vessels, to be there held
in readiness to receive on board for transportation such supplies as
may be furnished by the people of the United States for the destitute
and suffering people of France and Germany.” The resolution was
passed, after debate, in which Senators Howard of Michigan, Conkling
of New York, Morton of Indiana, Casserly of California, Schurz of
Missouri, and others, made brief speeches. Mr. Sumner spoke as follows:&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap">MR. PRESIDENT,&mdash;If I were compelled to determine
our comparative obligation to France
and Germany, I should hesitate; and what American
could do otherwise? I look at the beginning of our
history, and I see, that, through the genius of our greatest
diplomatist and greatest citizen, Benjamin Franklin,
France was openly enlisted on our side. She gave us
the Treaty of Alliance, and flung her sword into the
trembling scale. Through France was independence
assured; without France it must have been postponed.
Such, Sir, is our obligation to France, infinite in extent,
which, ever paying, we must ever owe.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Pg 320]</a></span></p>
<p>But is our obligation to Germany less? I cannot
forget that this great country, fertile in men as in
thought, has contributed to ours a population numerous
and enlightened, by which the Republic is strengthened
and our civilization elevated. France contributed to
national independence; Germany to national strength
and life. How shall I undertake to determine the difference
between these two obligations? We owe infinitely
to France; we owe infinitely to Germany. It is
within my knowledge,&mdash;indeed, I have learned it within
a very few days,&mdash;that, during this last year, Count
Bismarck, in conversation with a personal friend of my
own, said, with something of pride, that Germany had
in the United States her second largest State after
Prussia.</p>

<div class="medium">

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Wilson.</span> What did he mean by that?</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Sumner.</span> The German statesman had encouraged
emigration, by which Germans come here; so that there
is a German population among us larger than that of
any other German State after Prussia. Such, to my
mind, is the natural meaning of his language. Some
of the largest German cities are in our country; and all
this population together is itself a State.</p>

<p>But, Sir, why consider this comparison? Here is
simply a question of charity. Now charity knows no
distinction of persons, knows no distinction of nations;
especially does it know no distinction of friends. I
will not undertake to hold the balance between these
two mighty benefactors, to whom we are under such
great and perhaps equal obligations. Let us do all that
we can for each, with this understanding,&mdash;that, where
there is the most suffering, there must our charity go.</p>

Vol. IV. col. 514.) Upon which Hume remarks: “The Dutch were long at
a loss what to make of this article, till it was discovered that a portrait of
Cornelius de Witt, brother to the Pensionary, painted by order of certain
magistrates of Dort, and hung up in a chamber of the Town-House, had
given occasion to the complaint. In the perspective of this portrait the
painter had drawn some ships on fire in a harbor. This was construed to
be Chatham, where De Witt had really distinguished himself,” during the
previous war, in the way here indicated,&mdash;“the disgrace” of which, says
Lingard, “sunk deep into the heart of the King and the hearts of his subjects.”&mdash;<i>History
